<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h4>LONDON</h4>


<p>We had tasted of Spain before ever we had crossed her
frontiers. Indeed, perhaps Spain is the easiest
country to obtain samples from without the fatigue
of travelling. The Spaniard carries his atmosphere with
him: wherever he goes he re-creates in his immediate surroundings
more than a hint of his national existence. The
Englishman abroad may be English&mdash;more brutally and
uncompromisingly English than the Spaniard is Spanish&mdash;yet
he does not carry England with him. He does not, that
is, re-create England to the extent of making her seem quite
real abroad; there she appears alien, remote, somewhat out
of place. So, too, neither the Russian, the German, the
Dane, the Portuguese, the Italian, nor the American can
carry with him the flavour of his homeland in an essence
sufficiently concentrated to withstand the insidious infiltration
of a foreign atmosphere. To some extent the Scandinavian
countries, Norway and Sweden, have this power;
but Spain is thus gifted in the greatest measure. These
three countries seem to possess a national unconsciousness
which fends them off from too close a contact with lands
which are foreign to them; perhaps one might almost accuse
them of a lack of sensitiveness in certain aspects....</p>

<p>However, be the reason what it may, we had gathered
some experience of Spain in Paris before, and in London
during the war. What we had tasted we had liked, and so
when in our low-ceilinged attic refuge in London we gazed
out upon a sky covered with flat cloud, as though with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
dirty blanket, and wondered how we might escape in order
to seek for our original selves&mdash;if they were not irretrievably
lost&mdash;we thought of Spain. I think that we went to Spain
to look for something that the war had taken from us. It
was as though the low ceiling of our room, and the low-lying
sky, shut us in with something which was not altogether
true; indeed, we feel that many years must pass before
the dissipation of this curious sensation of unreality which
the war had stamped on to every one, except the most
callous.</p>

<p>It is now clear that peace is the normal condition of the
human race. In the olden days this was not the case, but
the tendency has been changing, and to-day we increase our
powers during times of peace, and our powers fall from us
during the disorganizations of war. The artist, who is the
barometer of social change, was attuned to peace. In peace
he exercises important functions. But with the sudden
outbreak of war the whole foundation of his being was suddenly
torn away. When war broke out Art for the artist seemed
almost meaningless. In the face of a human catastrophe
who could paint pictures? Nero may have fiddled while
Rome was burning, but it must have been a poor meaningless
tune that he played, some popular jingle, a Roman variation
of "Ta-ra-ra-Boom-de-Ay." We had come at last to a
peace which still carried on its breezes all the poisons of
war, and we, at least, felt an imperative need of escape to
some place where the war had not been; to some place where
perchance life had carried on a not too distorted existence
since 1914.</p>

<p>Spain drew us to her more than did Scandinavia.
Romance certainly had a finger in it; the sun perhaps two
fingers&mdash;for we are undoubted sun-worshippers; the music
of Spain, which had attracted us in Paris, causing Jan to
abandon the banjo for the guitar, added an appeal; and I
think an exhibition of Spanish landscapes by Wyndham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Tryon at the Twenty-One Galleries settled the matter. We
had been in Majorca before the war, and this combined with
our experience of Spaniards in Paris had fixed in our minds
a belief in a simplicity and courtliness of the Spanish people
which we hoped would be very soothing. Finally, two
houses were offered by a friend rent free for the whole of the
summer, together with introductions which would smooth
the way. We then packed up painting materials, stamped
clothes into a trunk, worried a strangely assorted collection
of packages down our narrow and twisted staircase into a cab,
and so&mdash;hey, for the Sun, southward!</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader should be warned that this is not
properly a book about Spain in the true sense of the
word; it is a book about ourselves. We are inclined to
doubt if, in the true sense of the word, a book can ever be
written about a country. Curiously enough the native
scarcely perceives his country at all as long as he is living in it.
When he travels he may come to a clearer vision, but then
scarcely perceives with truth the country in which he is
travelling. We might say that by travelling he makes out of
the foreign land a sort of inverted image of his home. What
he relishes abroad is probably what is lacking, what he
dislikes abroad is perhaps more perfect in his own country.
And thus his vision of abroad makes, as it were, a mould,
and, if one could pour into it a substance which would reproduce
the exact reverse as one makes a cast, one might procure
a fairly faithful image of his unconscious judgment of his
own land. So perhaps if this book could be turned inside out
it might be found that, after all, stripped of its unessentials,
we have been writing a book, not about Spain, but about
England. Indeed, we have been writing about England
already&mdash;romance, sun, an interesting national music, the
guitar, and national unconsciousness are not assets to be

<h4>JESUS PEREZ</h4>


<p>Jesus Perez took us to Spain in spirit while we were
still in Paris. We were off to Spain to paint, that
being the normal course of our lives, but in addition
Jan had formed a fixed resolution that happen what might
he was not coming home without having bought a good
Spanish guitar by the best guitar-maker he could find, while
I wished to buy a Spanish lute. Arias and Ramirez, the two
best modern <i>luthiers</i> in Madrid, both had recently died; we
had, however, the address of the widow of Ramirez, who
carried on her husband's business, but faintly in Jan's mind
a cloud hung over the lady's name. He did not trust her.
Not she, but Ramirez had made those superfine instruments.
So we were overjoyed to meet Perez upon the Boulevard
Montparnasse soon after our arrival in Paris. Perez was a
friend of ours from the times before the war. He was almost
a mystery man. Native of Malaga, self-styled painter&mdash;though
he never showed his work&mdash;nobody could tell how he
had managed to make a living during fifteen years of apparently
unproductive existence. It is true that one summer
he had disappeared from the quarter, returning late in
November browned by the sun, and had explained that he
had been smuggling in the Pyrenees; but that event was an
exception, and for some months subsequently Perez was
obviously well off as a result of his risky enterprises. Normally,
he survived like so many others in the Quartier Montparnasse,
drawing sufficient nourishment (supplemented very obviously
by borrowing) from mysterious sources. But while most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
his confrères in penury had no talents, not even the talent
for painting, Perez did know the guitar. Rumour said that
he was one of the best amateur players of the Jota Arragonesa
in Spain. Rumour may have exaggerated without detracting
from the real quality of Perez's exquisite gift.</p>

<p>We saw a Perez very much polished up by so many years
of war. He wore a clean straw hat, new clothes of the latest
cut, a waistcoat of check with ornamental buttons, patent
leather boots with a lacquer which flung back the rays of
the June sun, and heavy owlish eyeglasses of tortoise-shell
fastened with a broad black ribbon. Indeed, so transformed
was he, that it was he who recognized us; and for some
moments we stood trying to pierce through the new
respectability, as though it were through a disguise.</p>

<p>Seated together at the "Rotonde" we exchanged some
petty items of news. Perez had but recently returned from
Spain; he had held a small exhibition, he said, which had
provided funds; pictures were selling well in Spain....
He was delighted to hear of our plan, and thereupon wrote
for us an introduction to a painter, a friend, who lived in
Madrid. "Un homme très serviable," he said, manufacturing
a French word out of one Spanish. Jan then asked his
question. "A good guitar-maker in Spain," said Perez,
pinching his lower lip between finger and thumb. He shook
his head slowly.</p>

<p>"A good guitar-maker," repeated Perez. "In Madrid,
eh? Frankly, no, I do not know of one at the moment.
And you are going away at once. Tomorrow. Well,
this afternoon I am free, that is good. The best guitar-maker
at the moment lives here, here in Paris. His name is
Ramirez. Yes, a relative of that other Ramirez. He has
found a new form for the guitar. More fine, more powerful.
Each one like a genuine <i>Torres</i>. You come with me. I
will show you one or two that he made from an old piano
which he pulled to pieces for the wood. Exquisite! And
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
if you like them, together we will seek out Ramirez and he
will make you one. He is very busy, oh, excessively busy,
but he will make you one because he is an old friend of mine."</p>

<p>So the hot afternoon found us sweating up the slopes of
Montmartre.</p>

<p>"First," said Perez, "I will take you to the house of a
friend who possesses two of Ramirez' guitars. One is one of
those made from the old piano. It is marvellous!"</p>

<p>But when we reached the street he could not remember the
number. It was four years, he explained, since last he had
been there.</p>

<p>"However," he went on, "not far away is another
possessor of such a guitar; possibly he will be in."</p>

<p>Up the hill we went into streets which became more narrow
and more steep, until at length he led us through a courtyard
with pinkwashed walls, up five flights of polished stairs, to a
studio door upon which a visiting card was pinned:</p>

<div align="center">
<span class="smcap">Auguste la Branche</span><br />
<i>Artiste Peintre</i><br />
<i>Aquafortist</i><br />
</div>

<p>The door, under Perez's knuckles, sounded hollow and
forlorn. We waited for a while, and Perez was beginning to
finger his lip when a faint shuffle on the other side of the door
changed into the noise of locks. The door swung ajar
revealing a small man, with a thin face and tousled head,
clad in pyjamas and a Jaeger dressing-gown which trailed
behind him on the floor. Failing to penetrate to the real
Perez, as we also had failed, he blinked inquiringly at us. A
moment of confused explanation ended with a warm hand-shake.
Perez explained our presence and our purpose; with
protestations of apology for his <i>négligé</i> M. La Branche led
us into his studio.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i010.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>From the card upon his door we must presume that
M. La Branche was both painter and etcher, and pictures
hanging from the walls, and an etching press almost buried
beneath a mound of tossed draperies, were evidences of the
fact. But where he found space either to paint or to etch
was a puzzle. The large studio was crammed with bric-à-brac.
Indian tables, Chinese tables, wicker chairs, lacquer
stools, screens, figures in armour, large vases, birdcages and
innumerable articles strewed the floor, across which narrow
lines of bare parquet showed like channels upon the chart of
an estuary. Over the chairs were heaped draperies, on the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
tables smaller bric-à-brac crowded together. Upon a sofa
thrust to one side sat a woman methodically sewing at the
hem of a long sheet. She took no notice of us, nor of M. La
Branche, but continued her sewing, careful, however, not to
swing her arm too wide for fear of banging into several guitars
and other musical instruments, which almost disputed possession
of the sofa with her.</p>

<p>Having cleared a table and sufficient chairs, M. La Branche
gave us <i>thé anglais</i>, by the usual complex French method.
Then from amongst his guitars he selected that made by
Ramirez, and sitting down began to play. It is strange how
a man's personality appears in everything he does. M. La
Branche in his paintings was an expert painter rather than
an artist; his etchings, large colour plates, showed a similar
skill with the burin. His music was of the same nature.
Everything that a practiced player should do, he did; his
nimble fingers raced up and down the frets, his tempo and
his modulations were impeccable, yet he did not make music.
But we had not come with the intention of hearing music,
but of hearing the qualities and power of the guitar, and this
was, perhaps, more ably shown by the technicalities of M. La
Branche than it might have been in the hands of a more
artistic though less able musician.</p>

<p>The shop of Ramirez, the luthier, was down the hill, and
to this, thoroughly satisfied about the excellence of his
instruments, we went, Perez grumbling to us in undertones.</p>

<p>"That fellow La Branche&mdash;he does not play Spanish
music. No&mdash;he comes from Toulouse. That explains it.
It is the talent of the South of France, all on the top, all
lively and excitable and showing off&mdash;that is how it is. Now
I tell you, Monsieur and Madame Gordon, just because of
that the Frenchman never will be able to understand our
music. You English are nearer to us. You, when you have
acquired ability, will play our music with much more insight
and much more sensibility than that La Branche."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>This comforted us exceedingly, for one day in wrath
Modigliani, the Italian painter, had said that it was mere
impertinence for an Englishman to think that he could
understand the subtleties of the music of Spain.</p>

<p>Ramirez almost makes his guitars out in the street.
His workshop was about ten feet square with a door six feet
wide. Here was a piece of pure Spain, though we could not
recognize it (at the moment having no data), ten feet square,
thrust bodily into the lower floor of a French house. The
only light came in from the door, but the door was nearly
as broad as the room. Almost blocking up the entrance,
Ramirez, a burly, blue-jowled Spaniard, with something of
the physical construction of a boxer, was working at delicate
shavings of wood. Behind him the wall was hung with
templates, cut from white wood, of the parts of the instruments
he was making, guitars and lauds and bandurrias,
strange instruments which Europe, outside of Spain, scarcely
knows. On a shelf at the back of the small shop were heaped
unfinished bandurrias bound with string, for the glue to
become hardened in them. The workshop of Ramirez was
not what we had expected. One is, I think, justified in
expecting a neatness, a delicacy, about the place where fine
musical instruments are made. Had Ramirez been a maker
of chairs, or even of cartwheels, his workshop, though small,
would have appeared appropriate; but that, from this
rough place, could come out "the most difficult of musical
instruments to make" disturbed one's sense of suitability.</p>

<p>The greeting which Ramirez gave us touched with doubt
the picture which we had conceived of the amiability of the
Spaniard. There was no cordiality in him. Some of his
aloofness cleared away when he had penetrated through the
disguise of a dandy to the real Perez beneath, but he continued
his occupation, and to the statement that we wished
him to make a guitar for Jan he shrugged his fat shoulders.
He declared that he had already too much work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those two instruments, for instance," he said, pointing
to two unfinished guitars elaborately ornamented standing
in a corner, "I have already been nine months over those,
and have not had time to finish them. It is true they are
exhibition instruments, for shops, and therefore have little
if any interest for me."</p>

<p>Perez led him on with compliments, thawing away his
frostiness gradually with Jan's admiration for the guitar of
M. La Branche. Suddenly Ramirez put down his tools.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, "I'll make the Señor a guitar.
Three hundred francs is the price, and it will be finished in
three months."</p>

<p>The bargain concluded, Ramirez picked up one of the
unfinished instruments. He handed it to Jan, exhorting
him to explore with a finger the exquisite workmanship of its
interior. He rapped on the belly with his knuckle, and at
the sound of its deep musical boom he smiled for the first
time. Ramirez, having thawed, did not freeze up again.
He began explaining the novel shape of his instrument, a
shape which had been worked out for him by a mathematical
philosopher. He said that the guitar was the most difficult
of musical instruments to make, requiring a volume of tone
which had to be produced from strings easy to pluck and
finger. A problem very difficult to solve.</p>

<p>"And the guitar I made for you," he said, turning to
Perez, "you gave it to S&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Perez.</p>

<p>"See here," said Ramirez, turning to us, "I make a
guitar, an excellent one, one of my best. This fellow comes
to see me, he hears the instrument. He says to me, 'Ramirez,
keep that guitar for me, and I will at once go to work in a
French munition factory, and I will work like a slave, and
every week I will send you money until the guitar is paid
for.' And I agree. And he goes and makes aeroplanes,
and does honest work for the first time in his life, I believe,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and every week he sends money to me. And the week it is
all paid up he stops work and goes off with the guitar. And
he is crazy about the instrument. And he goes back to
Spain and then he hears S&mdash;&mdash; playing. He is so enraptured
by the wonderful playing of the man, that he runs home,
fetches his guitar, and thrusts it into S&mdash;&mdash; 's hands, exclaiming:
'Here is an instrument worthy of you. It is too good
for me, for I am a mere bungler beside you.' And so he
gives away the guitar that he has laboured for. Ah yes,
you villain, I have heard of you."</p>

<p>As we went down the hill, Perez tried to explain away
this generosity so characteristic of his impulsive nature.</p>

<p>"It is not as though I would have played on the instrument
again after having heard S&mdash;&mdash; touch it. Every time that
I wished to play I would have thought, 'Ah yes, but if
only <i>he</i> were playing it and not I.' And I had to give it
to him, or perhaps I would never have been able to play
again."</p>

<p>He asked us to come that evening to a certain small café
in the Rue Campagne Premier; some other Spaniards were to
come also and there was to be playing and singing. We were
to come after the legal closing time, and we were to thump
on the shutters.</p>

<p>In the night, in the dark, we rapped upon the rusty iron
shutters, and one by one, like conspirators, were admitted
into the dimly-lit café. It was a small place, characteristic
of Paris, a combination of <i>buvette</i> with zinc bar, and cheap
restaurant with marble-topped tables. Five years ago a
good meal could be bought here for less than a franc. Behind
the bar bottles and glass vats reached up to the ceiling;
upon the dirty, green, oil-painted walls, cheap almanacs and
trivial popular prints hung, together with excellent drawings
and sketches, presented to Madame by her clients. One by
one the <i>invités</i> slipped in. Madame and her two girl waitresses
laughed and giggled at the kitchen door, while the <i>patron</i>,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
grey-moustached, hollow-eyed and cadaverous, uncorked the
bottles of wine behind the bar.</p>

<p>Here again for several hours the Spaniards re-created
Spain. Perez is a player of temperament. Half of his skill
and art he appears to suck from his audience. Thus at first
he plays but indifferently well; but any music will rouse a
crowd of Spaniards. To the growing excitement Perez
responds, playing the better for it, thus creating more enthusiasm,
and these interchanges continue, until he reaches
the limit of his ability. But he is so sensitive to his audience
that one indifferent person can take the edge off all his power.
This night there was no one unresponsive. The playing of
Perez became more and more brilliant. With his nails be
rasped deep chords from his responsive instrument; to and
fro he beat the strings in the remorseless rhythm of Jota
Arragonesa. In the dimly lit café the dark figures and the
sallow faces of the Spaniards were crowded about him in
an irregular circle. "Olé! Olé!" they cried, and clapped
their hands in time with the music. The air within the café
throbbed and pulsated with the music. "Mais, c'est très
bien," exclaimed Madame at intervals from her corner.
"C'est très amusant, hein?" Two of the younger men were
murmuring to the waitresses and were making them titter.</p>

<p>"Come," exclaimed Perez at last, "enough of this piece
playing. Let us have a song. Vamos! who will sing?"</p>

<p>But something, possibly my presence, deterred the
Spaniards from singing. They were shy as a group of schoolboys.
One at last began to chant in a high quavering falsetto,
but before the first half of his <i>copla</i> was ended he broke down
into a laugh of hysterical shyness.</p>

<p>"Why then," cried Perez, "I'll have to sing myself, and
Heaven knows I've got no voice."</p>

<p>The Spaniard believes that any singing is better than
no singing. One of his chief pursuits in life is that of happiness&mdash;"<i>allègre</i>"
he calls it. This <i>allègre</i> is produced not by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
perfect results but by evidence of good intentions. He
would rather have a bad player who plays from his heart
than a good player who plays for his pocket. Any singing,
then, so long as it is of the right nature, will suffice, no matter
what its musical effect. Perez's singing had <i>allègre</i>, but no
music. He lowed like a calf, rising up into strange throaty
hoarseness like a barrow merchant who has been crying his
goods all day, and descending into dim growls of deep notes.
But even he at last tired; and after Madame had been yawning
for some while, after the last bottle of wine had been drained
of its last drops, we slipped out one by one into the moonlit
streets of Paris and said our farewells on the Boulevard</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h4>THE FRONTIER</h4>


<p>I wonder what Charlemagne would have done if one
had whisked him down from Paris to the Spanish
Frontier in something under twenty hours? Probably
the hero would have been paralysed with terror during the
journey and would have revenged himself upon the magician
by means of a little stake party.</p>

<p>But what would have been magic and miracle to Charlemagne
remains in one's mind as a jumble&mdash;the interior of a
second-class carriage; antimacassars; an adolescent who ate
lusciously a basket of peaches, thereby reminding us that
French peaches ripen early in June; intrusive knees and superfluous
legs; an obese man who pinched my knee in his sleep,
probably from habit; touches of indigestion which made one
fidget, and in the dawn a little excitement roused by observing
the turpentine tapping operations at work on the pine-trees
by the side of the railroad&mdash;cemented together by the thick
atmosphere of a summer's night enclosed between shut
windows.</p>

<p>It is a strange fact that the more perfect do we make
travelling, the more tedious does it become&mdash;I wonder whether
the same may not apply to almost all progress in civilization.</p>

<p>The most primitive aspect of travel is that of walking,
and even upon the most tedious of walks the exercise itself
seldom degenerates into definite boredom, one is never far
away from one's fellow men, yet even if one is quite alone
the mere fact of walking is an occupation which cannot be
despised; of riding similar things may be said. Coaching
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
may have had its inconveniences, yet a coach drive cannot
have been lacking in definite interest. One was in very close
contact with one's fellow passengers, coaching made as strange
bedfellows as any adversity, and the journey was seldom so
short that one could enjoy a sort of snuffy insulation from
one's fellows&mdash;mutual discomforts, even mutual terrors of
footpads made a definite bond of humanity.</p>

<p>It is true that in all these primitive processes the act of
getting from here to there is prolonged&mdash;perhaps extremely
prolonged&mdash;but mere duration is not tedium. If the act
itself is interesting and vivid then the act itself is worth
while. To-day the act of travelling by a fast train is scarcely
worth while&mdash;the traveller can almost count it out as so much
time lost out of life. I fear that when the aeroplane is perfected
journeys will be performed in a tedium absolutely
unrelieved, and those patients who have to undertake journeys
would be advised to take a mild anæsthetic at the beginning.</p>

<p>What is missing to-day from the act of travelling&mdash;and
what lacks from much modern civilization&mdash;is the expectation
of the unexpected; the sense of adventure, the true sauce of
life.</p>

<p>Now to have the true sense of adventure it is not necessary
that one should always be expecting to meet a lion round the
corner. Any little thing will do, anything not before experienced,
anything that will give the imagination that extra
fillip of interest which will convince it that the world will
always remain a Fortunatus purse of new things to learn,
anything that will make positive the fact that the act of living
is also the act of growing,&mdash;anything of this nature will
contribute to the sense of adventure.</p>

<p>But the trend of civilization to-day is that all these little
interests are being quietly but very effectively crushed:
we fling them beneath the wheels of railway trains and into
the cogs of factories, with the result that only those experiences
which are too large for us to fling thus are allowed to flourish.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
We have, in fact, almost cleared away the little things and left
only the big. Now, if we turn the corner, either there is
nothing at all or, in one case out of a hundred, we find the
lion. In our railway travelling to-day, either nothing happens
or there is a railway accident; but we have turned so many
corners in our lives which led to the mere blankness of more
empty road, that the possibility of the lion has almost faded
from our minds&mdash;and so the sense of adventure in little, the
true sense of adventure, is in danger of atrophy.</p>

<p>Some day, I feel sure that this sense of adventure will
take a revenge on the civilization which would destroy it.
We kill off birds and caterpillars flourish. Some worm lies
near the heart of things ready to gnaw at the right moment.
I fear that never will they apply "preservation laws" to the
sense of adventure, or we, as adventurers, properly appreciated,
should be in receipt of a scholarship or of a civil list
pension.</p>

<p>We were too dazed by the drug of twenty hours of tedium
and sleeplessness to suck any adventure from the passage
through the French Customs House at Hendaye. But this
experience roused us so that we were quite mentally awake by
the time that we reached Irun. Here a problem confronted us.</p>

<p>We had in our large leather trunk a good many yards of
government canvas, several pounds' worth of paints, and ten
pounds in weight of preparation for turning the government
canvas into material for painting upon. We had heard that
the Spanish customs were very strict; very strict in theory,
that is.</p>

<p>"But if they worry you, bribe them a bit," had said a
friend. Were these things contraband? If so, how much
was one to bribe, and how was one to do it? There are plenty
of men with nerve enough to try to tip Charon for his trip
over the Styx, but Jan is not one of these.</p>

<p>Now for a man of Jan's kind to attempt a delicate piece
of palmed bribing often results in things worse than if he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
had left well alone. Ten to one there is a fumble and the coin
drops to the floor beneath the nose of the chief bug-a-bug.
So, fingering two unpleasantly warm five-peseta pieces in his
pocket, he prayed fervently to kind Opportunity to step in.</p>

<p>To his prayer the goddess answered. We had brought
with us from our Paris studio a mosquito curtain which once
before had been used in Majorca. As our baggage was packed
in London we had, rather than undo straps and locks, tied
this mosquito curtain, wrapped in clean brown paper, on to
the outside of our suit-case. Upon this the authorities flung
themselves.</p>

<p>"Hi!" they cried. "You will pay duty on this, it is new."</p>

<p>Two gendarmes and a clerk tore off the paper, pitched the
mosquito curtain into a pair of scales, weighed it and wrote
out the bill. All the while we had been clamouring, with a
sudden memory from Hugo: "Antigua, antigua, antigua...."</p>

<p>This clamour became suddenly effective as soon as the
officials had nothing to do than to collect the money. Instead
of cash we gave them a chorus of "Antigua, antigua." The
clerk and the two gendarmes then began what seemed to be
an impromptu imitation of Miss Loie Fuller in her celebrated
skirt dancing&mdash;mosquito curtain whirled this way and that
in voluptuous curves. They were looking for evidence.
Suddenly I pointed out a spot where perchance some full-blooded
mosquito had come to a sudden death in 1913, when
the world was yet at peace. The mosquito curtain was
refolded, the bill torn up. They were quite peremptory with
the rest of our luggage; so Jan dropped the two warm five-peseta
pieces back into his pocket.</p>

<p>However much one may be in a country, one never feels
that one <i>is</i> in the country until the door leading out of the
customs house has been passed. So we never really thought
of ourselves as being in Spain until we stepped on to the platform
where the train for Madrid was standing. With a bitter
shock, we realized that it was a chill day and raining. We
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
had come all the way from England, hunting the sun, to be
greeted in June by a day which would fit, both in temperature
and atmosphere, the tail-end of a March at home.</p>

<p>Of those minor adventures which make life so valuable,
some of the finest flowers amongst them which may be picked
are the delicate first impressions of a new country. These
impressions have a flavour all their own; they are usually
compressed within the space of one hour or so, and once
experienced they never return. New impressions indeed
one may gather by the score, but those first, fine savourings
of the new can never be retasted.</p>

<p>We had expected so much from Spain. We had hoped at
the first moment to open out our arms to her sun, to satiate
our colour sense with the blueness of her skies&mdash;we were
received instead with this grey, gloomy weather. How can
one describe the revulsion? It would be an exaggeration to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
say that it was as though we had touched a corpse where we
had expected to find a living man, but the revulsion was of
this nature though perhaps less poignant.</p>

<p>I left Jan to finish with the larger luggage and, securing
the aid of a porter, set out to look for an hotel. At the exit
of the station I was accosted by a sallow man with a large,
peaked jockey cap pulled down over a thin face.</p>

<p>He said: "Hey, Señora! Hotel? Spik Engleesh. Yes."</p>

<p>"We don't want a dear place," I answered in English.
"We want a cheap one, understand?"</p>

<p>"Hotel. Spik Engleesh. Yes," replied the tout.</p>

<p>"Cheap hotel&mdash;cheap," I said.</p>

<p>"Hotel. Spik Engleesh&mdash;yes," said he.</p>

<p>"Puede usted recomendarme una fonda barata?" said
I, out of the conversation book, though the "<i>barata</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at
the end was my own.</p>

<p>But the tout turned sulky and would not answer&mdash;I
suppose he thought his fee would diminish if he were enticed
into Spanish. The porter stood on one side; he was a small,
inadequate man and he sniffed continually. Whether he
had caught cold from the rain, or whether he was expressing
his private opinion of travellers, I did not learn. Jan was
arranging about our trunk and a hold-all; I had in my charge
two thermos flasks, a camera, two rucksacks&mdash;memories of
days in the German Tyrol before the war&mdash;and a suit-case
which had been with us in Serbia and which still bore the faint
traces of a painted red cross, but the cat had for the last two
years been sharpening her claws upon it and the leather now
looked something like "Teddy Bear" material. These I
distributed between the porter and the tout, and, trusting to
Providence and my own powers of observation, we entered
Irun.</p>

<p>Where was the queer magic which lies in the first impressions
of a new land, the dreamlike quality, the unreality which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
almost puts one's feet for a moment into Fairyland? Spain
had played a nasty trick upon us; the grey sky and the low-lying
cloud and the drizzling rain had nothing of Fairyland
for us. With head held low against the drizzle one was
conscious of nothing but a wall on the right hand and of dirty
pavement beneath the feet.</p>

<p>The tout led me into the first house we reached. There,
was a narrow passage which passed by a room of a dingy
whiteness; but the tout showed me on, up some stumbly stairs
and through a spring door. We came into a dark room in
which, by means of the light filtering through the slats of
the closed shutters, could be seen the dim outlines of a bed
and of a tin wash-hand-stand.</p>

<p>"Ocho pesetas," said the tout.</p>

<p>"Por todo," I answered.</p>

<p>"Todo&mdash;todo&mdash;comida y toda," protested the tout. I
had been waiting for this moment. In the conversation book
which I had been studying was a phrase which had caught my
fancy; it meant "no extras," but it was much more beautiful.
The time had come.</p>

<p>"No hay extraordinario?" said I sternly.</p>

<p>"No, Señora, no," said the tout, spreading out his hands.</p>

<p>The matter having been thus settled, he took me downstairs
again; and, in the dingy white diningroom, introduced
me to a plump woman, the proprietress. I was ravenously
hungry; the tables were laid. I asked:</p>

<p>"What time is lunch?"</p>

<p>"At two, Señora."</p>

<p>I was dismayed. It was now eleven o'clock&mdash;we had
eaten little since the night before.</p>

<p>"But," I stammered, "I am hungry. Tengo hambre."
My memory shuffled with conversation-book sentences and
faint recollections of Majorca, but could find nothing about
the minutiæ of food.</p>

<p>"Tengo hambre," I repeated desperately. Suddenly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
inspiration came to me. I made motions of beating up an
omelet and clucked like a hen that has laid an egg.</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence, a positive kind of
silence, which is much more still than mere absence of noise.
Then a roar of laughter went up. The fat hostess shook like
a jelly, the tout guffawed behind a restraining hand&mdash;he had
not yet received his tip&mdash;while an old woman who had been
sitting in one of the darker corners, went off:</p>

<p>"Ck! Ck! Ck! He! He! He! Ck! Ck! Ck! He!
He! He!"</p>

<p>At this moment Jan arrived, having deposited the bigger
luggage and having been informed that the train to Avila,
our first stopping-place, went out at 8 a.m. I led him along the
dark passage and upstairs. He flung wide the shutters. The
window looked into a deep, triangular well at the bottom of
which was a floor of stamped earth, a washtub and a hen-coop.
Windows of all sizes pierced the walls at irregular intervals
and across the well were stretched ropes, from some of which
flapped pieces of damp linen or underclothes. In the light of
the open window the room was dingy. We wondered if there
were bugs in it, for we had been cautioned against these insects.</p>

<p>But the room did not smell buggy; it had a peculiar smell
of its own. The strong characteristics of odours need more
attention than novelists give them. For instance, I remember
that German mistresses had a faint vinegary scent, but French
governesses an odour like trunks which had been suddenly
opened.</p>

<p>This room had an austere smell. It smelt, I don't know
how, Roman Catholic: not of incense nor of censers, but of
a flavour which, by some combination of circumstances, we
have associated with Roman Catholicism in bulk. The bedroom
door was largely panelled with tinted glass; it had a
very flimsy lock, but we did not fear that we would be
murdered or burgled in our bed.</p>

<p>The omelet was ready when we came down. The diningroom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
had two doors, one leading to the kitchen, one up
some steps and into the street. There was a broad stretch
of window and almost all the other walls of the room were
covered with big mirrors.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i025.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>About five grim people, mostly clad in black&mdash;including
the old lady&mdash;sat in the room and stared at us as we ate.
We could not avoid this disconcerting gaze&mdash;look where we
would we either caught a human eye or else, what was worse,
we were fascinated by a long procession of eyes passing away
into the dim mysteries of reflection and re-reflection of the
mirrors. We had to choose between the gaze of one real old
lady or of twenty-five reflected old ladies, of one callow youth
or of twenty-five youths diminishing towards the infinite.
The audience stared at us as we ate our omelet, watched the
fruit&mdash;apricots, cherries and hard pears&mdash;with which we finished
the meal, and noted each sip of coffee. At last, unable to
bear any longer the embarrassment of this mechanically
intensified curiosity, we took refuge in our bedroom and lay
down. We then noted that the bed was too small, all the
rest of the furniture, on the contrary, being much too big.</p>

<p>We rested till lunch. The omelet and the fruit had but
filled some of the minor vacancies within us and we were
ready again on the stroke of two. Once more we faced the
Spanish stare and all the reflected repetitions of it. A fair
number of persons lunched at the hotel. As they came in
the women sat themselves directly at the table, but the men
without exception went to the far corner where, suspended
against the wall, was a small tin reservoir with a minute tap
and beneath it a tiny basin. Each man rinsed his hands in
the infinitesimal trickle, before he sat down to dinner. Why
the men and women made this distinction we could not guess.
It seemed to be a custom and not to be dependent upon
whether the hands were dirty or not. Even if the hands had
been dirty the small amount of water used would not have
cleaned them.</p>

<p>In the centre of the dining table were white, porous vessels
containing drinking water. The water oozes through the
porous clay and appears on the outside of the vessel as a faint
sweat. This layer of moisture evaporates and keeps all the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
water in the vessel at several degrees cooler than the surrounding
atmosphere.</p>

<p>Between mouthfuls of soup and wedges of beef the diners
were watching us. As soon as the meal was over we fled
into the streets of Irun. One cannot call Irun Spanish.
It is abominably French, though France is pleasant in its
own place. The café in the little plaza is French, with a
French <i>terrasse</i>, French side screens of ugly ironwork and glass,
and faces a square full of shady trees between which one sees
modern fortifications of French appearance. So we sat
sipping coffee and we said to ourselves: "Forget that you
are in Spain. Put off your excitement. Don't waste your
sensations with false sentiment"</p>

<p>Nor did the fact that all the wording on the shops was
Spanish, nor even the sight of a building of pure modern
Spanish architecture rouse us from our cloudy resignation.
The building which towered into some six stories by the side
of the railway was of a maroon brick. The lower story,
including the entrance door, was decorated with <i>appliqué</i>
in the design which the French used to call "l'art nouveau,"
and which now is confined almost exclusively to the iron work
on boulevard cafés. It is marked by exaggerated curves.
The whole bottom story of this building was sculptured in
this fantastic fashion; in order to fit in with the decorations
the front door was wider at the top than it was at the bottom,
while the windows were of every variety of shape, squashed
curves, dilated hearts, indented circles and so on. Above
this story the building rose gravely brick save for the corners,
which were decorated with bathroom tiles of bad glaze upon
which flowers had been painted; roses, violets and pansies:
the top story, however, was part Gothic, part Egyptian, with
a unifying intermixture of more bathroom tiles.</p>

<p>A munition millionaire went to an art dealer saying he
wanted a picture, but he didn't mind what sort of a picture
it was provided it looked expensive. We imagined that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
architect of this house had received a similar order. Later
on we were undeceived.</p>

<p>A yellow tram went by bearing the name "Fuentarabia."
Having heard eulogies of this place, we decided to go. We
reached the terminus of the tramway and the conductor
told us we were there. Since then we have met so many
people who were in ecstasies about the beauties of Fuentarabia,
about its pure Spanish character, etc., etc., that we are still
wondering if we went to Fuentarabia after all</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h4>MEDINA DEL CAMPO</h4>


<p>If civilization were without a flaw, the happy civilized
traveller could pass through and circumambulate a
foreign country yet never come into closer contact
with the inhabitants than that transmitted through a Cook's
interpreter. So that if you want to learn anything about
a country, either you must put a sprag into the wheels of
this civilization or you must let Opportunity do it for you.
Opportunity is a very complaisant goddess: give her an inch
and the ell at least is offered to you. She smiled upon us
when we decided to stay the night at Irun; once more she
smiled when the porter told us that the train to Avila left
about eight o'clock, so we humped the two rucksacks and
the suit-case from the inn to the station, got our trunk and
hold-all from the baggage office and went to buy our tickets.
Then we realized what Opportunity had been up to. The
ticket clerk refused to give us tickets to Avila.</p>

<p>"Why not?</p>

<p>"The train does not go through Avila, it goes to Madrid
by the other branch through Segovia. The train by Avila
goes at four."</p>

<p>"Where, then, does it branch off?"</p>

<p>"At Medina del Campo."</p>

<p>"Then give us tickets to Avila and we will wait at Medina
del Campo."</p>

<p>But the authorities did not approve of this novel
idea. It seemed that the through-ticket system had not
become the custom in Spain. We must then take tickets
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
to Medina or wait in Irun till the proper, respectable Avila
train should go, so to the astonishment of the booking clerk
we said:</p>

<p>"All right, give us tickets for Medina."</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

</div>

<p>I do not believe that any pleasure traveller had stopped
at Medina before we did. That is the impression we received,
both from the behaviour of the porters at Irun and of those
at Medina itself.</p>

<p>The scenery from the railway was, as scenery always is,
fascinating because of one's elevation and the scope of one's
view, tiring because of its continuous movement. We passed
through mountains worthy of Scotland, very Scotch in colour,
and at last came out upon the big plain of Valladolid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>While we were streaming across this and the mountains
were fading slowly into a distant blue the luncheon-car waiter
announced his joyful news. We had heard that living in
Spain was going to be dear, so, with some trepidation, we
decided to take that train luncheon&mdash;for our financial position
did not encourage extravagance. The whole trip was, in
theory, to come within the limits of Jan's war gratuity&mdash;about
£120. We had calculated the railway travelling as £50
in all; this gave us £70 for all other expenses, including the
purchase of the musical instruments upon which we had set
our minds, and we hoped to stay for four or five months.
Yet in spite of the need for economy luncheon called us if
only as an experience.</p>

<p>The meal cost us about three and fourpence apiece: it
was a complicated affair of many courses&mdash;even in a Soho
restaurant the same would have come to about ten shillings,
so that the spirit of economy in us was cheered and inspirited.
Of our fellow passengers we remember nobody save a gigantic
priest who waddled slowly along the corridors, carrying,
suspended on a plump finger, a very small cage in which,
like a mediæval captive in a "little ease," was a canary almost
as large as its prison.</p>

<p>Medina station looked like an exaggerated cart-shed on
a farm; two long walls and a roof of corrugated iron&mdash;there
were no platforms, only one broad pavement along one of the
walls. A small bookstall was against the wall and further
along the pavement a booth of jewellery. This booth had glass
windows and "Precio Fijo"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;"No bargaining," in other
words&mdash;was painted across the glass in white letters.</p>

<p>Why Spaniards, <i>en route</i>, should have mad desires to
purchase jewellery, we have not learned, but these jewellery
booths are common on Spanish stations. The jewellers seem
to detest bargaining, for these words always appear on the
windows. I suppose the fact that the purchaser of jewellery</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>
<p>has got to catch a train may give him some occult advantage
over the seller. One may imagine him slamming his last offer
down on the counter and sprinting off with the coveted trinket
to the train, while the defrauded merchant is struggling with
the door-handle of his booth&mdash;so "No Bargaining" is painted
up, very white and very positive.</p>

<p>As we had nine hours to wait, there was no need to hurry,
so we allowed the crowd to drift out of the platform before we
began to see about the disposal of our luggage. Stumbling
about in Hugo Spanish we discovered that, owing to the
receipt that had been given us at Irun, our big trunk would
look after itself until claimed, but that there was no luggage
office or other facility for getting rid of our smaller baggage.
We, however, insinuated understanding into the head of a
porter, who thereupon led us to a door amongst other doors
in the wall labelled "Fonda." We came into a huge hall.
Across one end stretched a majestic bar four feet high, of
elaborately carved wood, upon the top of which were vases
of fruits, tiers of bottles and glittering machines for the
manufacture of drink. Three long tables were in the room,
two spread simply with coffee-cups. The third table occupied
the full length of the middle of the room. It seemed spread
for some Lord Mayor's banquet. Snowy napery was covered
along the centre with huge cut-glass dishes, stacked with fruit,
alternated with palms flanked by champagne bottles and white
and red wine bottles. Fully fifty places were laid, each place
having seven or eight plates stacked upon it while the cutlery
sparkled on either hand. A cadaverous, unshaven waiter
lounged about amongst this magnificence and lazily flicked
at the flies with his napkin.</p>

<p>This huge, deserted room, expectant of so many guests,
made one think of the introduction to a fairy story: one could
have sat the mad hatter, the dormouse and the March hare
down there, but one could never imagine that fifty passengers
could in sober earnestness crowd to have supper at Medina
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
del Campo upon the same day. No, rather here was one flutter
of the dying pomp and majesty of Spain.</p>

<p>We placed our bags in a corner of the pretentious room
and went from the station to look for the town. It was nowhere
to be seen. A white road deep in dust gleamed beneath
the afternoon sun and led away across the ochreous plain,
but, of town, not a sign. Yet the white road was the only
road; Medina must be somewhere, so off we walked. The
plain was not quite flat, it flowed away in undulations which
appeared shallow, but which proved sufficiently deep to swallow
up all signs of Medina del Campo at the distance of a mile.</p>

<p>First we came to a line of little brightly coloured hovels,
square boxes, many of only one room, then to a church, an
ancient Spanish-Gothic church surrounded by gloomy trees.
Suddenly the road turned a corner and we were almost in
the middle of the town. Medina was Spanish enough. Here
was the plaza at the end of which towered a high cathedral
decorated with colour and with carving. The plaza lay broad
and shining beneath the sunlight; loungers sprawled in the
shadows beneath the small, vivid green trees, and in the deep
stone arcades which edged the open square the afternoon
coffee-drinkers, clad in cool white, lolled at the café tables.</p>

<p>In the centre of the plaza was a fountain running with
water, and about it came and went a continual procession
of women bearing large, white amphoras upon their hips,
children carrying smaller drinking vessels, and men wheeling
long, barrow-like frameworks into which many amphoras
were placed. The shops and cafés were painted in gay colours
which were brilliant in the sun and which contrasted pleasantly
with the crude&mdash;as though painted&mdash;green of the trees and
the clear, soothing hue of the sky.</p>

<p>I know that historical things have happened at Medina
del Campo, but we are not going to retail second-hand history.
To us, as living beings, it is far more important that we bought
our first oily, almondy Spanish cakes here than that Santa
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Teresa (who started off at the age of ten years to be martyred
by the Moors) founded a convent in the town.</p>

<p>Medina is a dead place and must be typical of Spain.
It has a market, a plaza and a few ragged fringes of streets
more than half full of collapsing houses, and in this gay-looking
remnant of past glory are at least three enormous
churches with monasteries in attendance. But even the
churches are falling into ruin and the storks' nests are clustered
flat on the belfries, while Hymen's debt collectors, clapping
their beaks, gaze down from aloft into the empty roadways.</p>

<p>Sunset had played out a colour symphony in orange major
by the time we had arrived back at the station where we asked
for a meal; but the cadaverous, blue-jowled waiter had not
laid covers for fifty in order that intrusive strangers might
push in and demand food at whatever hour they chose.</p>

<p>"Supper," he said with some dignity and disgust at our
ignorance, "is at eight."</p>

<p>So out we went on to the pavement platform, found a
lattice seat and ate the cakes we had bought. They were like
treacly macaroons, so oily that the paper in which they had
been wrapped was soaked through, but it was with pure
almond oil and the cakes were delicious. Lunch had been
eaten at twelve and in trains one never eats quite at one's
ease; hunger had gripped us when eight o'clock struck by
the station clock. We took our seats at the long table before
those piles of plates. A quarter-past eight went by, half-past
eight was approaching. One by one about six or seven persons
sauntered into the room and seated themselves, distant from
each other in comparison with the size of the table as are the
planets in the solar system. Nearest to us, our Mars, as it
were, was a very fat commercial man, his face showing
the hue of the ruddy planet. Our Venus was represented
by a pale young priest, his long wrists projecting far from
the sleeves of his cassock. Mercury looked appropriately
enough like one who was always travelling; Saturn was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
covered with rings&mdash;he must have been one of the customers
of the "precio fijo" booths&mdash;the other planets were lost
amongst cumulus of fruit and cirrus of palm.</p>

<p>The waiter became active. Balancing a large soup tureen,
he ladled a thin, greenish soup into the upper plate. We then
understood that we would have to eat our way down through
the pile of plates, each plate a course. Mars rushed at his
soup in such a wild manner that we felt it was a good thing
indeed that the soup-plate was thus raised so near to his
mouth or fully the half of the soup would have drenched his
waistcoat.</p>

<p>Alice again was recalled to my mind. I remembered her
dismay during her regal banquet when the dishes once introduced
to her were whisked away from under her nose, for
every time I laid down my knife and fork to speak to Jan my
plate was seized and carried off by the cadaverous waiter.
No sooner was I introduced to a new Spanish dish than it was
wrested from me. Twice this had occurred. On the third
occasion I lay in wait: as the waiter swooped for my plate
I seized it. There was a momentary struggle, but I had two
hands to his one; he retired with a look of astonishment on
his face. Gradually I became aware of the fact that Mars
never loosed his knife and fork until he had cleared his plate.
He held both firmly in his two red hands. If he drank&mdash;which
he did with gusto, throwing his head back, washing
the wine, which had a queer tarry taste, about the inside of
his mouth, almost cleaning his teeth with it&mdash;he held his fork
sceptre-wise as if to say to the waiter, "Touch that last corner
of beefsteak at your peril." When he had quite finished the
course, when he had mopped up all the remnants with a piece
of bread, then and then only did he lay down both knife
and fork. Unconsciously I had been giving a signal to the
waiter.</p>

<p>After the beefsteak we had a surprise. One has been so
long accustomed to the French custom in gastronomy, that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
one almost forgets that courses are not arranged in an immutable
order. Once indeed I did make a bet in Paris that I
would eat a meal in the inverse direction, beginning with the
coffee and sweets and ending with the soup&mdash;which, by the way,
proved very hard to swallow&mdash;but the mere fact that one could
bet about it proves how fixed one imagines the laws of food
progression to be. At Medina del Campo, after the beefsteak,
which was about the third item on the menu, the waiter
brought us fried fish, thereby proving that gastronomic
progression is not so unalterable as is usually imagined. The
fish looked like very small plaice, but they had a strange
flavour which we had never before tasted. That the fish had
been packed for several days in rotting hay seemed the nearest
description and explanation, and we would have clung to this
idea if the salad had not also had a perceptible tang of this
unpleasant taste. We asked the waiter what the flavour was,
but our Spanish broke down under the strain, and the waiter
said "Claro"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and went away.</p>

<p>For some weeks afterwards the word "Claro" became our
bugbear. The Spaniard gets little amusement from hearing
his language spoken by foreigners. If the unfortunate
foreigner does not get pronunciation, accent and intonation
perfect the Spaniard says "Claro," in reality meaning "I
can't make head or tail of what you are talking about." Both
laziness and courtesy make the Spaniard say "Claro," and
often the poor foreigner is quite delighted with his progress
in the language&mdash;the people tell him that everything he says
is perfectly clear, hooray; he thinks that he must have an
unsuspected gift for languages&mdash;until one day he asks the
way to somewhere and receives the usual answer, "Claro."</p>

<p>The Redonda Mesa,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which would I think be the Spanish
for a "square meal," cost us again four pesetas, and it was
an even better three and eightpenn'orth than we had been
given on the train. The meal finished, the planets held a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

public tooth-picking competition for a while, then one by
one they resumed their normal orbits and passed from our
sight.</p>

<p>We, with the processes of digestion heavy upon us, went
back to the seat in the ill-lit station. Three more hours we
had to wait for the train to Avila, so we sat in the mild night
watching the only engine at Medina&mdash;an engine which looked
like an immediate descendant of Stevenson's Rocket&mdash;push
trucks very slowly to and fro. This engine, though it made a
lot of spasmodic noise, did not destroy, it only interrupted,
the intense silence which lay over the country-side. The
platform was quite deserted. Presently two small boys
came along. One had a red tin of tobacco which he offered to
Jan; Jan shook his head but did not answer. They then
tried to talk to us, but we knew better than to expose our
imperfect Castilian to two small boys&mdash;so we kept silence.
At last they said we were "misteriosos" and went away.</p>

<p>A luggage train steamed in. At the tail end of the train
were three third-class carriages, and from these carriages,
as well as from the waggons, poured out a mob of wild-looking
men. They were dark brown, unshaven, covered with broad
tattered straw hats, clothed in rough and ragged fustian and
carried blankets of many coloured stripes. Huge bundles,
sacks and strange implements were slung upon their backs.
As they crowded in beneath the dim lamp at the station
exit one could almost have sworn that all the figures from
Millet's pictures had come to life. A smell of the soil and of
labour and of sweat went up from them. These men were
peasants from Galicia; they had come in third-class carriages,
in goods waggons, travelling probably for two or three days,
attached to luggage trains, across the country to the harvesting.
One by one they passed out, their voices trailed away into
the night towards Medina, and once more the silence came
back.</p>

<p>Time wears itself out in the end. The train to Avila,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
when it came, was fairly empty, so we could lay ourselves out
at full length and rest, disturbed, however, by the continual
fear that we might overshoot our destination.</p>

<p>It was pitchy night when we clambered down from the
train at Avila. The large barn of a station was lit by but
three minute lamps and the glow from the fonda door. In
the semi-darkness the passengers moved about like ghosts,
each intent on his own business. It was two o'clock in the
morning, so before exploring we again put our baggage in a
corner of the fonda; where also we found the one waiter
presiding over a banquet laid for fifty non-existent guests.
Speaking as little of the language as we did, it seemed impossible
to go exploring a foreign town in the dead of night for a hotel
which would probably be shut when we found it. So, feeling
somewhat like Leon Berthelini and his wife in Stevenson's
story, we sat down on a seat in the station to await the
dawn.</p>

<p>The temperature of the night was almost perfect; there
was a hint of chill in our faces which, however, did not penetrate
through the clothing. For awhile porters moved about
arranging luggage, then one by one the three lights were
extinguished and the station was left to darkness. One porter
clambered into a carriage which was standing on a siding; as
he did not come out again nor pass down on the other side we
imagine he went to bed in it. We were tempted to follow his
example, but feared the train might move off unexpectedly
and carry us to some remote part of Spain before we could wake
up. One can tempt opportunity too far.</p>

<p>But the seat was hard. If, like Berthelini, we had had
a guitar we might have performed miracles with it similar
to his, but we had left our guitars in England. So Jan went
exploring. Outside the station he found a small omnibus,
its horses eating hay out of nose-bags. Hearing faint voices
he discovered a sort of dimly lit underground bar annexed
to the fonda, in which the driver of the omnibus and a friend
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
were drinking spirits, while the tired waiter lounged yawning
behind the counter. Our ignorance of Spanish prevented
us from thrusting ourselves into their company: but we
waited for the driver to attend to his horses and in halting
Hugo we asked him at what hour the omnibus went to the
hotel. He replied "In the morning" and went back to his
drinking.</p>

<p>The eau-de-nil of dawn found us on the edge of shivering,
but the day warmed rapidly. A train thundered into the
station pouring out its cascade of passengers. Gathering up
our packages and tipping the waiter fifty centimes, we found
a new omnibus which was labelled "Hotel Jardin" and took
our seats inside. Dawn was over by the time we reached the
hotel, though it was but four o'clock. We had a confused
impression of great buff battlements overhanging the buildings,
of a few stunted bushes, of one or two girls in black, of a huge
room which was to be our bedroom and then&mdash;bed&mdash;sleep</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h4>AVILA</h4>


<p>Borrow has a description of an inn in Galicia in which
a whole family occupies but one bedroom while the
servant sleeps across the door. Our bedroom in the
Hôtel del Jardin was quite large enough for any family other
than, perhaps, a French Canadian, which sometimes runs,
we have heard, into twenties and thirties. The walls were
painted a pinky-mauve stucco, decorated with a broad olive-green
ribbon of colour making a complete oblong or frame
on each wall about eighteen inches within the edges of the
wall, top, bottom and sides.</p>

<p>This method of making, as it were, a separate frame of
each wall, was novel and rather pleasant. It is a common
practice in Spanish wall decoration and is probably Moorish
in origin. The hotel was full of dark corridors leading to
huge bedrooms: it had a broad veranda upstairs full of large
wicker chairs, bottoms up, while downstairs was a dining room
with square tables and a small entrance hall in which
sat the three old ladies.</p>

<p>With one of the old ladies we had bargained in a sleepy
way upon our arrival. She had conceded us the room with
full <i>pension</i> (no extraordinarios) for eight pesetas a day, but
in general the three old ladies sat in the entrada together,
giving a sense of black-frocked repose and of quiet dignity
to the place. One was thin-faced, dried-up but energetically
capable; one was large and motherly, while the third had no
characteristics whatever and was ignored by every one.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>

<div align="center">

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I do not think we realized that these three old ladies were
the proprietresses until the second or third day at lunch-time.
We had been given our seats at a table by the waiter; suddenly
we found the three old ladies had surrounded us and were
glowering down at us. We were rising to our feet but they
peremptorily commanded us to stay where we were, breaking
the rising tide of their wrath upon the waiter. Then, for the
first time, we realized how completely we were married in
Spain. In France, for instance, married people are "les
époux," plural, separate; in England they are a "married
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
couple," which still recognizes a duality though perhaps less
definitely than does France; but in Spain we were "un
matrimonio," indissolubly wedded into one in the language,
and into a masculine one at that. Somehow I always felt
that we ought to be wheeled in on casters: it was improper
that so stately a thing as a matrimonio like the Queen of
Spain should use legs. From the old ladies' annoyance we
understood that the matrimonio had done something which
was not correct, but they talked so fast, and they all talked
together, so that the matrimonio could not make head or tail
of what they were saying. Nor indeed did we ever discover
our misdemeanour.</p>

<p>For our six and eightpence a day we had breakfast in a
little side room. This meal was of <i>café au lait</i> in a huge
bowl, rolls and butter. Sometimes we had companions for
this meal. On the second day I was some minutes earlier
than Jan. At the table was a young peasant priest. He
ignored my tentative bow but began muttering to himself
protective prayers in Latin. However, once I looked up
suddenly and surprised him in the act of staring at me. He
quickly crossed himself and redoubled the urgency of his
protestations to God.</p>

<p>The other meals were excellently cooked and with four or
five courses to each, but the diningroom bore on its walls a
placard saying that owing to the rise of prices the management
regretted that it was unable to provide wine at the
<i>pension</i>. So there was an extraordinario after all&mdash;and a very
good extraordinario it was too&mdash;red Rioja wine with the faint,
strange exotic taste in it of the tar with which the wine
barrels are caulked.</p>

<p>You know the queer old drawings one finds in ancient
books: towns like bandboxes with the walls round a perfect
circle, and peaked houses all comfortably packed inside, and
soldiers' heads sticking out of the battlemented towers? Well,
Avila is like that. You may stand on the opposite hillside
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and see the full circle of her walls with never a breach in it,
with towers at every two hundred yards or so, and you can
gaze down into her houses, fitted neatly within the bandbox,
and wonder if the old manuscripts were quite as exaggerated
as one often supposed. From this hillside one might imagine
that Avila has never changed from the days when the monks
drew their primitive pictures. The walls top the hill-side
and one sees nothing of the modern Avila which has spread
beyond those great frowning gateways facing the plaza, but
even the modern part of Avila which has oozed out beyond
the walls is not overwhelmingly modern. There are none
of the exquisite specimens of Spanish bad taste like that we
found in Irun. The plaza is surrounded by coloured houses
and arcades much as is that of Medina; the sun-blinds of the
two large cafés are tattered and weather-beaten; the peasants
stare at strangers with an unspoilt curiosity.</p>

<p>The habit of rushing about towns, of penetrating into
every gloomy interior, ecclesiastical or otherwise, which seems
to be decently penetrable, is a modern convention to which
we do not subscribe. There are two aspects to every place,
the living and the dead, and we prefer the former. There is
this advantage in our attitude, that one does not have to seek
out the living, it flows quite easily and naturally by, and one
does not remain an open-mouthed spectator with a jackdaw
brain, but incorporates oneself with it. We did not go into
the cathedral, nor into any convent, nor did we climb up the
towers or into the walls: we sat at the café drinking in both
coffee and Spain.</p>

<p>Of costume, as Spain is so often painted, there was little;
the peasant men wore tall, flat-brimmed hats and broad,
blue sashes about their stomachs; the women shawls and
woven leggings; the mules and donkeys had trappings of
bright-coloured woolwork and often saddlebags with fine woven
coloured patterns on them. String-soled sandals were
the footwear of the men and of the soldiers: string-soled shoes,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
alpagatas, were worn by the women and children. The town
was moderately alive until eleven o'clock. Very early in the
morning the peasants came into the market with their mules
or donkeys, then gradually a quiet settled down, a quiet which
lasted till the evening. After six o'clock Avila awoke, the
business men left their shops, the officers their cantonments.
The cadets and youths gathered in the plaza to flirt with the
girls who, dressed in gay cottons, paraded to and fro in small
giggling and swaying groups. Booths selling cool drinks
and ices opened at the corners of the plaza, while wandering
sweetmeat merchants sold fried almonds and sugared nuts.
There was no woman with a lace mantilla and a high comb,
nor any one with a flat hat, embroidered shawl and cigarette;
so the cigar boxes are liars.</p>

<p>As one sits at the café table in Spain, life is, perhaps,
presented to one in an aspect almost too crude. Lazarus
lay at the rich man's gates exhibiting his sores, and the
Spanish beggar follows his example. Spain needs no Charles
Lamb to write of the decay of beggars. Decayed indeed they
are, but not in that sense of which Lamb wrote: in tattered
and unspeakable rags they pursue their trade from the
Asturias to Cadiz. No dishonour attaches to beggary in
Spain. A Spaniard was horrified when Jan told him that
begging was not permitted in England.</p>

<p>"What, then, can those do who are unable or unwilling
to work?" he asked.</p>

<p>A humble though probably verminous official refuge is
provided for the beggar in each town, and, as he tells his clients,
"God repays" his small extortions. The Spaniard is accustomed
to his beggars, he does not nag at his conscience about
them, but it harrows the unaccustomed heart of the Englishman
who, taking his modest coffee or Blanco y negro after
supper, finds a procession of misery thrusting importunate
hands into his moment of quiet luxury. The Spanish beggar
has no tenderness for one's sensibility. Each has the motto,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"If you have tears prepare to shed them now." Naturally we
were their quarry. They presented us with a series of specimens
worthy of a hospital museum. We hardened our hearts,
as we were afraid of consequences, but after two days, when the
beggars, disappointed with us, relaxed their exertions, we gave
or withheld alms with the outward serenity of a Spaniard, but
feeling inwardly brutal whenever we refused to give a dole.</p>

<p>Dirty, half-naked children dodged about the café pillars,
hiding from the waiter's eyes. They stared wistfully at the
small, square packets of beet sugar which the waiter brought
with the coffee, and if a lump were left over they would creep
up and in a cringing whine ask for it. Boys slightly older
usually begged for a perra chica or for a cigarette. Their
voices would be pathetic enough almost to break one's heart&mdash;they
would say they had not eaten for three days&mdash;but if
the refusal was decisive they would suddenly change their
tones and shout out gaily to a comrade or run away whistling,
or turn a few cartwheels down the gutter.</p>

<p>In Avila, too, we encountered the money problem. We
had been told that the Spaniard calculates his cash in pesetas
and centimos, the peseta being worth normally tenpence in
English money and the ten-centimo piece about one penny.
So far this had worked fairly well, we had been on the
travellers' route and the peculiarity of travellers had been
catered for; but here we found a new system of coinage.</p>

<p>"How much is that?" I asked a woman in the market,
pointing to some object.</p>

<p>"That," she replied, "is worth six 'little bitches.'"</p>

<p>"Six what?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Well, three 'fat dogs,' if you prefer."</p>

<p>"Three 'fat dogs'?"</p>

<p>"Yes, or one 'royal' and one 'little bitch.'"</p>

<p>"But I cannot understand. What is a 'royal'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know? Why, twenty 'royals' make a
'hard one.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>At last we worried it out. The little bitch (perra chica)
is five centimos, or one halfpenny. The fat dog (perro gordo)
is the ten-centimo piece; these are both so called because of the
lion on the back, though why the sex should be changed we
do not know. The royal (real) is twenty-five centimos or
twopence-halfpenny, the "hard one" (duro) is a five-peseta
piece. The peseta is ignored. Nobody except an ignorant
foreigner calculates in pesetas. The Spaniard, who often
cannot write, does staggering sums in mental arithmetic,
reducing thirty-two "little bitches" or seventeen "royals"
almost instantly into the equivalent in minted coin.</p>

<p>We had come to Spain for the several reasons mentioned
in Chapter I. We had found the freedom: it was as though
some oppressing weight were lifted from off us, as though an
attack of mental asthma had been relieved. But on the whole
we felt that we had been defrauded in other respects. The
weather, except for the afternoon at Medina, had been very
cloudy and at times almost cold. We had heard no guitar
during our week in Spain. One day a man with a primitive
clarinet, accompanied by a man with a side drum, had
wandered about the town making a queer music which had
given us thrills of unexpected delight. But Jan does not play
the clarinet. He had made up his mind about guitars, and
guitars he would have. The last night which we were to
spend in Avila, he said:</p>

<p>"See here, Jo, we'll go out and we'll walk up and down,
through and round this town, till we hear a guitar playing.
Then we will walk in and explain. I'm sure the people, whoever
they may be, will not mind, but I am going to hear
Spanish music."</p>

<p>After supper we set out again. We walked the town from
the top to the bottom. Not a whisper of guitar or of any other
music. We bisected the town from left to right&mdash;still silence
except for the dim sounds of normal evening life. We went
out into the little garden which was beyond the walls and,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
leaning on the parapet, stretched our ears over the small
suburb beneath. The cries of a wailing child or two, of a
scolding woman and the shouts of an angry man answered
us; of music not a note. We walked round the walls and
were about to return in disappointment to the hotel, when
Jan said "Hush!"</p>

<p>We listened. Barely audible, from below on the hill-side,
came the faint tinkle of a guitar. We looked out across the
dark country. The hill sloped steeply from our feet and rose
again in planes of blue blackness to the distant mountains.
Almost in the bottom of the valley we saw a square of light
from an open door. The sound came from this direction.
Cautiously we crept down the hill, which was steep, pebbly
and without paths. As we came down, the noise grew louder.</p>

<p>There was a small drinking house or venta by the roadside;
near to it, drawn up on a grassy spot beneath some big
trees, were gipsy caravans and booths, and as we passed by we
could see, dimly white, the blanketed shapes of the gipsies
as they lay on the grass asleep under the stars. From the
venta came the sounds of music.</p>

<p>After a momentary hesitation we went in. The room,
lit by one dim lamp, was crowded with gipsies and workmen.
It was long in shape and an alcove almost opposite to the door
was partitioned off as a bar. At one end was a table upon
which three gipsies with dark, lined Spanish faces were sitting,
and the audience had formed itself into rough, concentric
semicircles spreading down the length of the room. Most
of the men were swarthy with the sun, clad in the roughest
of clothes, some with tall hats on, others with striped blankets
flung over their shoulders. The inn looked like what the
average traveller would describe as a nest of brigands.</p>

<p>We murmured a bashful "buenos noches," bowed to the
company and crept into the background. A few returned our
greeting, but with delicacy of feeling the majority took no
overt notice of our presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>The man on the table who held the guitar began to thrum
on the instrument. A tall gipsy, whose face was drawn into
clear, almost prismatic shapes, and who might have stepped
out of an etching by Goya, put his stick into a corner, slipped
off his blanket and, standing in the open space before the
table, began a stamping dance, snapping his fingers in time
with the rhythm. A workman standing near to us said:</p>

<p>"That man does not play the guitar very well, the other
one plays better."</p>

<p>He went out and in a short while returned with his wife,
a laughing woman whom he placed next to me. There was
no drinking of wine. The alcarraza, an unglazed, bottle shaped
drinking vessel, full of water, was handed about.
It has a small spout, and from this the Spaniard pours a fine
stream of water into his mouth. But beware, incautious
traveller&mdash;ten to one you will drench yourself.</p>

<p>Though the audience apparently took no notice of our
presence, in reality they were extremely conscious of us. One
by one, as if by accident, gipsy women clad in red cottons
came into the already crowded room. Soon a girl was urged
to dance. She demurred, giggling. At last she was pushed
into the open space, and with a gesture of resignation she
began to dance. We are not judges of Spanish dancing:
we had been looking for atmosphere, and had plunged into the
thick of it. This was no café in Madrid or Seville got up
for the entertainment of the traveller. This was the true,
natural, romantic Spain. Opportunity again had blessed her
disciples. One of the women pushed her way out of the door,
and in a short while returned, dragging with her a child about
nine years old. The little girl's face was frowning and
angered, the sleep from which she had been roused still hung
heavy on her eyelids.</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed the audience. "She dances well."</p>

<p>The man who was reputed the better player roused himself
from the table and sat down on a chair. They put castanets
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
into the child's hands. The man struck a few chords and
slowly the music formed itself into the rhythm of a Spanish
measure.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i049.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Relaxing none of her angry, sleepy expression, the child
danced wonderfully. The castanets clashed and fluttered
beneath her fingers, her skirts swirled this way and that, her
feet beat the floor in time with the pulsation of the guitar.
The audience shouted encouragement at her. With a wild
series of movements, the dance at last came to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brava! Brava!" cried the gipsies.</p>

<p>"One day that girl will be worth much money," said a
man, with approval in his voice.</p>

<p>Then the best male dancer took the floor. With true
artistic instinct he did not attempt to rival the active dancing
of the child, but performed a stately movement, holding his
arms above his head, and slowly turning himself about.
When he sat down an old man of seventy or so began a series
of senile caperings, thumping his stick on the floor. The
audience rolled with laughter at the ancient buffoon.</p>

<p>For some while Jan had been wondering whether he should
pay for two or three bottles of wine for the company, but we
did not know the delicacies of Spanish etiquette, nor had we
sufficient language in which to make an inquiry, so, pushing
my way to the child who had danced so well, I pressed a few
coppers into her hand. She looked up at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do, then?" she asked.</p>

<p>Our Spanish failed to shape a proper reply, so I smiled at
her as answer.</p>

<p>"Buenos noches," and "Muchos gracias," we said to the
crowd, and made our way out again into the night.</p>

<p>We were followed up the hill by a gipsy boy who begged
cigarettes, but he had pestered us during the whole of our
stay at Avila, and we did not feel kindly towards him. Nor
indeed had we any cigarettes to give, because Spain was
suffering from a tobacco famine, and those which we had
brought with us from France had just come to an end.</p>

<p>The next morning we left the Hôtel del Jardin, which owes
its name to the fact that it possesses in the front a tiny square
of earth on which grow five bushes and a small tree. We
were bound for Madrid</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h4>MADRID</h4>


<p>Madrid Station was the usual dark barn into which
the trains ran and where they rested, as the diligences
rest beneath the barn of the coaching inn. One
descended the steps of the carriage into gloom; found a
dim porter whom one would never recognize again; made
one's way amongst the towering, sniffling black Pargantua of
locomotives; was fought for by an excited mob of cabmen,
amongst whom one remained passive until a cabman dowered
with more character than his fellows had managed to attract
one's notice; and finally we were packed into a small, four-square
omnibus, our luggage on the top, the driver and his
tout on the box. A police official in a grey uniform halted
us. He asked our names, our destination and warned us
not to pay the driver more than five pesetas for the trip,
including the luggage.</p>

<p>To-day was Sunday. We had, indeed, on getting up at
Avila imagined it to be Saturday. We were leaving Avila
expressly on a Saturday in order to be in Madrid for the great
Sunday bullfight, for practically all bullfighting in Spain
is reserved as a mild sport for Sunday afternoon, or for other
days of Church festival. Unfortunately, we had learned on
the train that it was not Saturday but Sunday. Somehow,
we had mislaid a day. We had presented ourselves with a
Wednesday or a Thursday or a Friday too many, and now
Sunday had gone bang and the bullfight with it.</p>

<p>But in consequence our entry into Madrid had some of
the dignity of a royal procession. We plunged, a shabby
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
omnibus, into the flood of carriages which parade the parks
of Madrid on bullfight occasions. There were doubtless
ladies with high combs placed in their raven hair; with
lustrous eyes glowing from the deep caverns of their eye sockets;
with a waxy and sensuous flower hanging from their
full-blooded lips; clad in mystery-lending mantilla and
gorgeous shawl, over which the Orient has burst a splendour
of silken blossom. There were, no doubt, such spectacles to
see; there must have been; all the artists who paint Spain
cannot lie. Yet I confess that we did not see them. Though
we are beginning to be suspicious of Spanish painters, we will
not assert that no such ladies drove in procession, tempting
the lounging Spaniard with glances from eyes of melting jet.</p>

<p>We did not see them because the whole flood of carriages
was plunged in a strange golden haze. Dusk had fallen and
overhead signs of daylight showed purplish through the fog,
but lower down it was quite dark, and through this haze
of orange-gold particles, which drifted in the air as golden
particles drift in a chemical solution, the lamps of the carriages
threw long searchlights, arresting strange silhouettes of the
coach-borne crowd, so that we made our first acquaintance
with the people of Madrid merely as black shadows against
a radiance of gold. It was, indeed, somewhat a prophetic
introduction. These black shadows against the gold may
stand as a figure for Spain. We think of Spain as the land
of the last romance, whereas the Spaniard's real romance is
money and the gaining of it. But this is a mixing of secondary
and primary impressions. Before our eyes Madrid rolled
forward, gloating in an aureate solution, accompanied by the
shouts of coachmen and the blaring from aristocratic and
impatient motor-cars. We sat looking out of the black
windows of the omnibus with much of that childish delight
which a shadowgraph theatre gives. In time, however, we
began to cough. After a while longer we began to realize
that this haze so exquisite in the lamplight was dust&mdash;dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>We rolled along, manufacturing our halo as we went,
until, coming out of the press of carriages into cobbled and
ill-lit streets, our glory fell away from us and we rocked on,
reflecting on this apt illustration of the old French proverb
concerning beauty and suffering. Gradually we decided that
we could have dispensed with this weird introduction to Madrid
in order to have spared our throats.</p>

<p>Our friend Jesus Perez had given us an address appropriately
enough in the Place of the Angel. But there were
three <i>pensions</i> in the same building and he had not discriminated.
So I, leaving Jan to look after the bus, went to
explore, and knocking at random was brought face to face with
an old lady who had not a trace of the angelic in her constitution.
While she was grumpily and wilfully misunderstanding
me, insisting that the Señor for whom I was looking
did not live there, a crowd of well-fed persons sifted from the
dining-room and stood in a circle staring at me with cold-eyed
curiosity. As they stared they all picked their teeth. At
last I forced understanding on her and she told me in a surly
voice that her <i>pension</i> was full. The other two <i>pensions</i> were
full also. It was explained to me that Madrid was suffering
from congestion, that never had such a season been
experienced.</p>

<p>So I retreated from the stairs and we held a council of
distress in the street. The driver of the bus, who did not
indeed look like a very competent judge, said that he knew of
a good <i>pension</i>. By a series of manœuvres, about as complicated
as the turning of a large ship in a small river, he got
his bus reversed and we set off again the way we had come.
But once more we met a refusal, backed by wide-eyed staring
and public tooth-picking.</p>

<p>We had the address of an hotel, as a last resource indeed,
for it was somewhat beyond our means, costing seventeen
pesetas a day <i>en pension</i>. So in despair we made our way to
it, wondering whether the congestion had spread from the eight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
peseta boarding-houses to the seventeen-peseta hotels, and
whether our first night in Madrid was to be spent in the bus.
We came back into the garishly lit main streets of Madrid and
at last the bus halted. There was no hotel front, and we
plunged between two shops along a passage from which
photographs of the beauties of Madrid showed exquisite sets
of teeth from the showcases of a society photographer. A
narrow, twisting staircase&mdash;the lift was out of order&mdash;spiralled
us up to a sumptuous hotel decorated with mirrors and white
paint arranged with a Permanic taste. Rooms were to be
had, and so we resigned ourselves to luxury for a few days.</p>

<p>Luxury indeed it was. For our eight pesetas a day in
Avila we had had as much as we wanted. Here it was in
proportion. We were expected to eat our seventeen pesetas'
worth a day. Course followed course until, more than replete,
we had to wave away almost the whole of the second half of
this truly Roman repast. The waiters were aghast. What?
Not eat seventeen pesetas worth when one had paid for it?
Incredible! We gazed about at our fellow diners and saw
that we were unique. But then as a rule our fellow diners
surpassed us as much in girth as in appetite; they had
"excellent accommodations." Your true Spaniard adores
his dinner. There is a general superstition that love is the
Spaniard's prime passion. But I doubt it. For the once
that we have been asked what we think of Spanish beauty,
we have been twenty times questioned about our judgment
of Spanish cooking.</p>

<p>Madrid at night. How much has one not dreamed of
southern romance beneath skies of ultramarine? But Madrid
seems just like any other large European city. It is Paris
without the wit, Munich without the music. We talk,
of course, of first impressions. The first impressions of a
town are rarely national. Collective humanity is collective
humanity everywhere; has the same needs and devises the
same methods of satisfying them. Some needs Madrid supplies
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
more blatantly than is done in other places. The Latin is
indifferent to noise and the Spaniard is the most hardened of
the Latin races. There seems to be no curb on the cries of
the street vendors. The consequence is that each shouts out
his wares in competition with his fellows; the louder the yell
the more the custom. The peculiar qualities of Spanish
singing further stimulate to a point of mordant acidity the
Iberian voice. For a person of sensitive hearing Madrid is
intolerable: newspaper men, flower-merchants, toothpick-sellers,
and above all the lottery ticket vendors, scream their
wares with nerve-racking persistency; added to which, to
make pandemonium complete, the cab-drivers and their touts
bellow and shout, while the horns of the motor-cars are the
most discordant that we have ever heard.</p>

<p>As the night progressed from a stifling heat to a comparative
coolness the noise seemed to increase. At two
o'clock in the morning we thought, surely, it had reached its
limit. And to some extent it had. One thanks Heaven
sometimes that the human machine runs down; and we,
when the "sweet sister of death" laid her hands upon newspaper
and lottery ticket sellers, sent a thanksgiving up towards
the stars, a thanksgiving the more sincere at the moment
because it was silent. The diminution of noise went on
steadily until about three, and we imagined that Madrid was
going to sleep. It was, however, but a ruse of the subtle city.
As is well known, one can become used to a persistent or
regularly repeated noise, for Jan used to sleep sweetly close
to the stamp battery of a mine, the din of which was so deafening
that the voice was inaudible, even at the loudest shout;
and dwellers near a railway line are but little disturbed by the
nightly trains. Madrid knew that in time we would become
accustomed to the human babel, in spite of its strident note;
so she substituted a fictitious silence torn into strips by the
sudden passage of motors which had taken advantage of
the clearness of the streets to put on full speed and also to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
cut off the silencer. Irregularly these motors went by about
one every five minutes. Each silence was about long enough
to let us reach the edge over which one tumbles into sleep,
and each roaring passage of a car jerked us back into disgusted
wakefulness. We arose to a very early breakfast, wishing
we had Mr. G. K. Chesterton at hand so that we could enter
into an argument with him about the beauties of liberty.</p>

<p>To retrace our steps for a moment, it was just about at
the hither side of the noise climax, that is, about 2.20 in the
morning, that we got back to our hotel. We found the street
door shut and locked, and no bell could we find to pull. We
thumped on the door, but only a hollow, drum-like echoing
answered us. We were dismayed. We had got up early at
Avila, a train journey and discoverings in Madrid had worn
us out, and on the other side of this locked door our bed
tempted us; for we were not then aware that sleep was forbidden
to us whether we got in or stayed in the street. It
seemed strange in Madrid, wide awake and noisy, that our
hotel should have locked up so early and should have shut
us out. Despairingly again we drummed on the door. We
awakened sympathy in a passer-by. A few words explained
our plight. He whistled, and we presently saw a man with
a lantern in his hand and with an official cap on his head
coming towards us. Our helper explained and the official
unlocked the door, let us in, and locked the door behind us.</p>

<p>This wandering latchkey is the equivalent to our old
night-watchman. Amongst his duties is that of chanting out
the hours of the night as they pass&mdash;for the benefit of the
sleepless&mdash;to which he adds the condition of the weather.
Since fully ninety-five per cent. of the Spanish nocturnes are
Whistlerian blue, he has earned the title of El Sereno, or the
serene. There is an advantage in this custom&mdash;one cannot
forget one's latchkey. The worst evil which can happen to
one is that one's latchkey may forget itself: but Spain is
on the whole a sober country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>A big town reveals its flavour but by degrees. Madrid,
whatever its real character may be, had hidden herself behind
a veil&mdash;a veil of dust. That golden aura which had enveloped
our first vision was not a permanent characteristic of the
town. The dust hung in the air, rising higher than the
houses. From the outskirts, maybe one would have seen
Madrid as it were enclosed in a dome of dust. We marvelled
that people could live in such at atmosphere.</p>

<p>We had noticed that, in addition to its dustiness, Madrid
was suffering from a dreadful shortage of water. It was, of
course, July, and one might expect some famine on the high
and arid tableland of Spain, but we wondered that so great a
city could have arisen with so meagre a water supply. At
street corners queues of tired women and children waited for
hot hours with buckets, pails, jugs and amphoras. Soldiers
with a hose pipe from which trickled a paltry stream of water
filled the vessels one by one. There was gaiety and bad
temper, giggling and quarrelling amongst the women.</p>

<p>"This," said we, "is a primitive city."</p>

<p>In the public gardens water-carts were standing, and crowds
of men were baling water up from the decorative ponds.</p>

<p>"A real famine," said we, "could not be worse than
this."</p>

<p>This was in fact the case. Madrid is supplied from the
mountains by an ancient aqueduct. The Spaniard has a
principle of interfering with nothing until the last moment;
the ideals of liberty are carried so far in Spain that they apply
to inanimate objects as well as human beings. Thus, if the
aqueduct wishes to break, it is allowed to do so. Panic
ensues. The government is criticized, but words hurt nobody.
The aqueduct had given way a few days before our arrival.
Had it not been for the generosity of a nobleman who turned
a private water supply into the conduits of Madrid, we would
have found not calamity but catastrophe.</p>

<p>Madrid was unsavoury enough. The breakdown of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
water-supply entails also the failure of the drainage system.
In a land of wine one might dispense with water as a mere
drink; but to dispense with flushed drains in a semi-tropical
climate is impossible.</p>

<p>One late afternoon we were in our bedroom, having taken
advantage of the quiet which reigns from one p.m. till five,
(for we got no other sleep during out stay), we heard a faint
strange murmur which seemed to be drawing nearer. We
went to the balcony and looked out. The sound was coming
from the direction of the Puerto del Sol, the sun's gate, the
torrid centre of Madrid so well named. The sound drew nearer.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Soon it shaped itself into a word murmur from thousands of
throats:</p>

<p>"Agua, agua, agua."</p>

<p>The word passed us and fled down the streets, sweeping
before the hesitating trickle which crept along the gutters.
With the word a communal shiver of delight ran through the
town, like a sort of physical earthquake. Before six o'clock
the road men were dragging their hoses about the street,
and the rising damp was dragging the dust out of the air</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h4>A HOT NIGHT</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>This Chapter should be omitted by Prudes</i>)</p>


<p>The expense of an omnibus is not necessary to the experienced
traveller. A Spanish friend took us to a
bureau of town porters in Madrid, and we gave instructions
to a dark-faced man in a shabby uniform, who
promised to see all our baggage to the station in good time for
the evening train to Murcia. Señor Don Mateo Bartolommeo
was the name of the porter, for he gave us his visiting card,
on which was his professional and private address, and a deep
black mourning border like that on one's grandmother's
envelopes.</p>

<p>The preliminaries to travelling in Spain are lengthy. The
ticket office opens fifteen or twenty minutes before the train
leaves, but the passengers arrive an hour before, so that there
is always a long queue waiting at the ticket office. One can
buy either tickets for the journey or tickets for the thousand
or more kilometres. The latter are a great saving if one does
much travelling, but they entail further delay at the booking
office, for verifying, tearing off, stamping, and so forth.
Then with one's tickets one goes to the luggage bureau, where
the van luggage is weighed, overweight charged, and a long
slip receipt given. The luggage is then presumed to travel
to the journey's end and should be forthcoming on the production
by the passenger of the receipt. This is not invariably
the case; but of that we will tell in its place. The wealthy
traveller does not undergo all this fatigue. He shows a porter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the luggage for the van, tells him the station to which he wishes
to travel, gives him the money to pay for ticket and luggage,
and bothers his head no more about it. The Spanish porter
is unusually honest. You can give him two or three hundred
pesetas to buy tickets with, and a few minutes before the
train starts up he runs with the tickets, the luggage receipt,
and the exact change.</p>

<p>We, however, wanted to experience everything; we did
not wish to spend our small capital on exorbitant tips, so I,
leaving Jan to see to the tickets and heavy luggage, argued my
way past the ticket collector, who is supposed to let nobody
on to the platform without a ticket, found an empty carriage,
appropriated seats, and sat on the step waiting for the porter
to bring up the smaller luggage. An old lady in black, with a
huge bandbox and a birdcage, accompanied by three hatless
girls dressed in purple silk, all carrying at least four parcels
apiece, filled up my compartment, and I thought: "We are
going to have a stuffy time of it."</p>

<p>The train was full of talk. In the corridors the people
chattered at the top of their voices like a rookery. Presently,
conversing in shrill tones, the old lady and her three daughters
swooped back into the carriage, and with much rustling of
silk dragged all their parcels to some other part of the train.
A young officer, carrying about six packages, took one of the
vacated places, and marked his seat by unbuckling his sword,
which he placed in the corner. An old man, rather run to
stomach, took the seat opposite the soldier. He then stood
in the doorway, wedging his stomach into the opening, so
that nobody else should enter. The time drew closer to the
departure of the train.</p>

<p>The noise increased a hundredfold. Three girls rushed
along the corridor and unceremoniously butted the old gentleman
in the waistcoat. The corridor was filled with a confused
crowd of people, who handed in large hat-boxes, brightly
striped, square cardboard boxes, small suit-cases with gilt
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
locks, and a huge doll. The carriage was filled with a strong
smell of scent. There was giggling and the kissing of adieux.
The escort then retreated down the corridor and the three
girls set to arranging themselves for the journey. One of the
girls was very dark, her face like old ivory, her eyes large
caverns of gloom, and her mouth painted a brilliant scarlet;
one was fair with a long face and grey eyes, very excitable
in manner, talking a high-pitched Spanish with a queer
intonation; the third was bigger than either of her companions,
yet less remarkable. One could easily have imagined
her dressed in cowgirl's costume, performing in a travelling
Buffalo Bill show. All three had bobbed hair, though that
of the second girl was an elaborate <i>coiffure</i> of short hair rather
than a mere bob.</p>

<p>The dark girl picked up the soldier's sword and tossed it
into the luggage rack. The cowgirl pushed the stout old
man's suit-case out of his corner and took his seat. The old
man but grinned and guffawed, seeming pleased rather than
angry. The soldier stood in the corridor and glowered at the
dark girl through the glass. He offered no objection to the
robbery of his seat, but it was evident what were his thoughts.
The second girl flung herself down on the seat next to Jan, blew
out a long sigh and exclaimed: "Aie, que calor, que calor."</p>

<p>It was indeed hot. All day long the sun had been beating
down into Madrid. The Puerto del Sol had been more like
the "Puerto del Infierno." The little trickles of water which
the repaired aqueduct had afforded to Madrid had done little
to mitigate the dull reverberant heat of the still air. Even
now that the night had come the air was yet quivering, and
came into the lungs like half-warmed water.</p>

<p>The girls got down their dainty suit-cases from the rack,
opened them, burrowing amongst tawdry finery, manicure
sets, powder-boxes and other articles of toilet use, found boxes
of cigarettes. To do this, the cowgirl placed her suit-case on
the seat and, standing, bent over it. The stout old man, with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a giggle, leant forward and gave the girl a resounding smack
with his open palm upon that part of her which was nearest
to him. The officer, through the glass, frowned and pursed
up his lips. The girl next to Jan caught my eye, smiled at
me, and winked.</p>

<p>"Aie, que calor!" she exclaimed, blowing cigarette smoke
into the air.</p>

<p>The train dragged itself out of the station and started
southward through the night.</p>

<p>The girl who was sitting next to Jan broke out into unexpected
French.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! Qu'il fait chaud!" she exclaimed, as though
Spanish would not properly express the quality of the heat.</p>

<p>"But," said Jan to her, "you speak French very well."</p>

<p>"Well," she retorted, "I ought to, seeing that I am
French."</p>

<p>Suddenly she came to a resolution. She stood up and
again took down her suit-case. She took from it a wrapper
of tinted muslin. Slowly then she began to take off her
clothes. Her silk dress she folded up very neatly and laid
along the little rack which is set just below the ordinary one.
Then she slipped off her petticoat and camisole, and put on
the muslin wrapper.</p>

<p>"That is better," she exclaimed; folded up her discarded
underwear, put it into the suit-case, which she then replaced
on the rack.</p>

<p>She then began on her <i>coiffure</i>. She detached a series of
little curls from over her ears, and twisting the wires on which
they were made into hooks, she suspended them from the
netting of the rack, where over her head they swung to and
fro with the movement of the train.</p>

<p>"Maintenant," she said, "on est plus à son aise. Besides,"
she added, with the instinct of true French economy,
"it does so spoil one's clothes if one takes a long railway
journey in them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The act had been performed with naturalness, and in view
of the heat of the night we could not help envying the French
girl for her good sense in making the long journey as comfortable
as possible.</p>

<p>She began to tell Jan the story of her life. "Mother was
a nuisance," she said; "she made life a little bit of hell at
home. Well, one day we had a fine old flare-up. I told
mother that she could go to the devil if she liked, and I just
packed up and ran away. I came down to Madrid, and on
the whole I haven't done so badly. I send mother about
eight hundred pesetas a month. Most of that she'll keep for
me, and I'll have a nice little sum to start business with when
I get back. Of course one can't keep up a quarrel with one's
mother for ever. <i>Hein!</i>"</p>

<p>Jan asked her how long she had been in Spain.</p>

<p>"Four months," she answered.</p>

<p>"You speak very good Spanish," said Jan.</p>

<p>"Oh," she answered, with a touch of desperation in her
voice, "one can't be all day doing nothing. It's a distraction
learning something new."</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?" asked Jan.</p>

<p>"We are all going to Carthagena," said the French girl.
"We'll be down there all the summer. There are English
there too, I have heard&mdash;sailors. I like sailors. You see, I
had to get away from Madrid. I had a friend, and one day
while I was out he stole all my spare money, and all my
clothes, which he took to the pawnshop. And that left me
stranded. Then I heard these two girls were going to
Carthagena, to a place, so I said, 'I'll come too,' and here I
am. Anyway one has to be somewhere, and I adore knocking
about. It's life, isn't it?"</p>

<p>The dark girl was merely a selfish, pretty animal. She
curled up on the officer's seat like a black cat. She then
slyly prodded the poor little stout man with her high heels,
so that he gradually moved up towards me, leaving me little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
room in which to sit, while the dark girl could stretch out at
her ease. The other girl sat in her corner, saying little,
smoking cigarette after cigarette. She seemed to be one of
those stolid creatures who drop through life, taking good and
bad without change of face or of manner. She might have
been rather South German than Spanish. In contrast with
these two the French girl was simple and attractive. One
noted, too, that she had a fine streak of unselfishness in her
character; she even talked without bitterness of the man who
had robbed her.</p>

</div>

<p>Young men drifted along the corridors and stared in at the
girls. One man, who looked well off, dressed in a tweed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
sporting coat, came in and made friends. He gave them
cigarettes and drinks of brandy from a flask. At about one
o'clock in the morning, one of the cardboard boxes was
opened and disclosed a large pie, which was divided. The
stout old gentleman had a piece, so did "Tweeds." Some
was offered to us, but we had dined well at Madrid and did not
feel hungry. But to refuse in Spain is a delicate matter, so
we gave them cigarettes to indicate goodwill.</p>

<p>We stopped at a dark station. The door was flung open
and a tall sunburned man clambered into the carriage. He had
around his waist a broad leather belt which was stuck full of
knives. These implements were clasp knives, and varied
from small pocket knives and pruning knives to veritable
weapons a foot in length. He was not a famous brigand,
though he looked one, but a salesman. The larger knives
had a circular ratchet and a strong spring at the back, so that
upon opening they made a blood-curdling noise, which in
itself would be enough to induce any angry man to finish the
matter by burying the blade in his enemy's gizzard. He did
no business in our carriage, and went off down the platform
opening and shutting a sample of his murderous wares, crying
out: "Navajos! Navajos!"</p>

<p>The train went on, and as we reached southward the night
became warmer. The stout old man left us, and the black
girl stretched out at full length, occasionally prodding me
with her French heels. Presently the darkness became less
opaque. A faint silhouette of low hills, and then a dim
reflection from flat lands, appeared.</p>

<p>We stopped at another station; an unimportant wayside
station with a small house for booking-office and a drinking-booth
in a lean-to alongside.</p>

<p>"I must have a drink," exclaimed "Tweeds." "Who will
come with me?"</p>

<p>Neither the black girl nor the cowgirl would move. We
had still lemonade in our Thermos flasks. So the French
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
girl, in her muslin <i>peignoir</i>, and "Tweeds" clambered down
the carriage steps and disappeared through the door of the
fonda.</p>

<p>Disappeared is the right word. Without warning, the
train began to move. It gathered speed and clattered away
southward. We never saw "Tweeds" or the French girl again.
In the thinnest of <i>négligés</i> she was left stranded upon the
wayside station, to which no other train would come for at
least twelve hours, and possibly not for twenty-four.</p>

<p>The day broke, and we pounded along through a dusty
arid country. There was green in the bottom of the valley,
but from the roads rose high columns of dust, while the
plastered villages of box-like houses near the railroad were
dried up and dust-coated. Dust blew in through the carriage
windows and settled thick upon the curls which, still swinging
and bobbing from the netting of the rack, were fast leaving
their mistress behind. At first her companions had been
anxious; now they were laughing.</p>

<p>"But," they said, "we wonder if she knows where to
come for her things when she does arrive?"</p>

<p>The train became more crowded. Soon people were
running up and down, looking angrily for places. Third-class
passengers began to fill the corridor of our second-class
carriage. A boy of about nineteen, with the half-angry
intense face characteristic of some Latins, came into the carriage
and demanded a seat from the dark girl who was still stretched
at full length. This seat "Darkey," with her habitual selfishness,
refused to give up. Suddenly, we were in the middle of a
full-fledged Spanish row.</p>

<p>To us it had a comic side. It was not what we would
have called a row, as much as a furious debate. Of course
with our slight acquaintance with Spanish we missed the
finer points of the varied arguments.</p>

<p>"Darkey" began by saying that she was keeping the seat
for a friend who was somewhere else. This was to some
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
extent true; the French girl was somewhere else, though there
was little likelihood of her claiming the seat.</p>

<p>The boy retorted that if she was somewhere else she
probably had another seat.</p>

<p>This argument went to and fro, increasing in acerbity.
Each of the quarrellers listened in silence to what the other
had to say, making no attempt to interrupt, though the voices
grew hoarse with anger.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i068.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Presently "Darkey" was telling the boy that he was a
wretched third-class passenger anyhow, and that he had no
right in a second-class carriage, and even if the seat were free
he wasn't going to have it.</p>

<p>The boy retorted by saying that anybody could see what
she was, and that her mother was probably sorry that she had
ever been born, etc., etc.</p>

<p>No English quarrel could have gone to half the length that
this proceeded. We were waiting to see either the boy jump
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
into the carriage and shake the life out of "Darkey," or to see
"Darkey" spring, like the young tiger-cat she was, at the boy
and scratch his face. But nothing happened. The crowded
corridor listened with delight to the progress of the quarrel.</p>

<p>The train stopped at a station. "Darkey" had sat up
to pulverize the impertinent youth with some evil retort. The
carriage door on the opposite side opened, and a placid, middle-aged
peasant woman, followed by an ancient peasant man,
stepped into the carriage, and before "Darkey" had well
discovered what was happening had squashed down in the
disputed seat, left vacant by the removal of "Darkey's"
feet. The woman grinned at us all and sat nursing a large
basket on her lap.</p>

<p>Then the quarrel slowly died down. After a while the
boy went away. However, he came back again whenever he
had thought of something good, and barked it round the
corner of the door at "Darkey," who, usually taken by
surprise, could find nothing to retort before he had lost
himself again in the crowd.</p>

<p>The peasant woman smiled at us all, and, opening her
basket, handed to each of us a large peach. She selected one
especially big for "Darkey," presumably as refreshment after
the tiring argument.</p>

<p>The day became hotter and hotter. The dust gathered
more thickly on to the French girl's poor little curls. When
the train stopped, children ran up and down beside the
carriages, selling water at the price of "one little bitch"
the glass. We were now in the province of Murcia, and the
scenery put on the characteristic appearance of that province,
tall bare hills of an ochreous mauve, sloping down into a flat,
irrigated, fertile valley. The division between mountain and
valley, between the "desert and the strown" was as sharp as
though drawn with the full brush of a Japanese. On the
mountains were dead remnants of Saracen castles, of dismantled
Spanish robber fortresses, and the white or coloured
buildings of monasteries which still lived sparkling in the sun</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h4>


<p>One has a right to expect that the station which is the
finish of a long and tiring journey should be both a
terminus and have a quality all of its own. Our
egoism makes it seem at that moment the most important
place in the world. But Murcia (pronounced locally Mouthia)
had only a big ugly barn of a station like many through which
we had already passed, and even lacked a Precia Fijo jewellery
shop. All we could see of the town, on emerging, was a few
houses and a line of small trees which appeared as though
they had been in a blizzard of whole-meal flour, so thick
was the dust. Over this buff landscape quivered the blue
sky.</p>

<p>In front of us were one or two cranky omnibuses and many
green-hooded two-wheeled carts. These carts were Oriental
in appearance and had the most distinctive appearance we
had yet noted in Spain. They were gaily painted, and the
hoods bulged with the generous curves of a Russian cupola.
Inside they were lined with soiled red velvet, and the driver
sat outside of this magnificence on a seat hanging over one
of the tall wheels. Into one of these we were squeezed in
company with two grinning travellers, and started off, soon
plunging into the shadow of an avenue of lime trees, behind
the grey trunks of which cowered insignificant little houses
painted in colours which once had been bright.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

<p>The more communicative of our fellow travellers said it
was indeed the hottest day of the year. It was hot, but we
were not oppressed by it, and found out in time that the
Spaniard always seemed to suffer from the heat more than we
did. Our endeavours to be agreeable in imperfect Spanish
worked up the traveller to a discussion on languages, and to
a eulogy on ourselves for taking the trouble to learn. We
said that we were artists. He answered:</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, that explains it. Poor people, of course, are
forced to learn languages."</p>

<p>We drove across a stone bridge, almost in collision with a
bright blue tram-car. A momentary glimpse was given to
us of a muddy river running between deep embankments;
and we drew up before a square barrack of red brick pierced
by a regiment of balconied windows. The proprietor, oily
like a cheerful slug, waved his fingers close to us, and drew
back his hand in delicate jerks as though we were rare and
brittle china. He preceded us into an Alhambra-like central
hall, led us carefully up a stone staircase to a wide balcony,
opened a door into a palatial bedroom with a flourish; and
demanded fifteen pesetas "sin extraordinario." Intuition
told us that this was not a case of "Precio Fijo," and we
reduced him gently to eleven pesetas before we accepted the
bargain. Then, to take off the raw edge left by the chaffering,
Jan said:</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you get many foreigners here, Señor?"</p>

<p>"Si, si!" returned the hotelkeeper, anxious for the
reputation of his caravanserai. "We get quite a lot. Oh,
yes, quite a lot. Why, only last year we had two French people,
un matrimonio; and this year you have come."</p>

<p>The maid was in appearance and behaviour like an india-rubber
ball, and the conviction was firmly fixed in her mind
either that we couldn't speak Spanish or that she could not
understand if we did. So she grunted, bounced at us and
smiled with her mouth wide open like a dog, hoping that by
this means she was translating a Spanish welcome into an
English one. With difficulty we dissuaded her from these
antics and persuaded her to speak, but she turned her words&mdash;which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
were already dialect&mdash;into baby talk; and the less we
understood the louder she shouted.</p>

<p>However, she was a kindly creature and succeeded in
cheering our spirits, which were flagging, for we were very
tired and almost ill, having barely recovered from a severe
attack of influenza before leaving London. We washed off
the thick dust and went downstairs into the large cool hall.
The central quadrangle had once probably been open to the
sky, but now was covered, five stories up, by a glass roof,
beneath which sackcloth curtains stretched on wires shut out
the sun. There were comfortable wicker chairs all about,
and the hall was decorated with four solemn plaster busts,
one in each corner. We were curious to find out who were
thus honoured in a southern Spanish hotel. One was of
Sorolla, a popular Valencian painter, one was of a woman,
a poetess. The other two we did not know, but think
they represented contemporary literature and architecture.
Imagine finding in an English hotel hall busts of Brangwyn,
Mrs. Meynell, Conan Doyle and Lutyens.</p>

<p>The hall was cool. We ordered coffee and buttered toast.
But the butter was rancid, for we had crossed the geographical
line, almost as important as the equator, below which butter
is not, and oil must take its place.</p>

<p>Four children, making a lot of noise over it, were in the
hall, playing a game peculiarly Spanish. The smallest boy,
who always had the dirty work to do, carried flat in front of
him a board, to the end of which were fixed a pair of bull's
horns. He dashed these at his comrades in short straight
rushes. Two of the other boys carried pieces of red cloth
which they waved in front of the bull. The fourth boy
carried a pair of toy banderillas, straight sticks, covered with
tinted paper and pointed with a nail. As the bull rushed the
"banarillero" dabbed his sticks into a piece of cork. Then
they decided that the bull was to die. One of the cloak-wavers
took a toy sword which he triumphantly stuck into the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
cork. With a moan the small boy sank on to the floor. His
companions seized his heels and dragged him round the tiled
floor of the hall. The game seemed to us a little tedious;
later on we were to learn how like to actual bullfighting it
was.</p>

<p>The hotel interpreter, for whom we had inquired, now
came in. He spoke in French:</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i073.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>We wished to find a gipsy guitar-player named Blas, and
we had been told that the interpreter knew his house. We
feared that he might be in Madrid, where he sometimes played
in the Flamenco cafés; but the interpreter said that he was
in Murcia, and that we could look for him at once.</p>

<p>From the cool hall we stepped into the blazing sun of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
midday Spain, crossed an open space so dazzling that it hurt
the eyes, and entered a maze of narrow, tall streets. Jan and
I moved along in single file, clinging to the narrow margins of
shadow which edged the houses, while the interpreter with a
mere uniform cap on his head stalked imperturbably in the
sunlight. Across squares we hurried as rapidly as possible to
the shadow on the opposite side. The houses were orange,
pink, blue or a neutral grey which set off the hue of the tinted
buildings. The squares were planted with feathery trees of a
green so vivid that it appeared due to paint rather than to
nature.</p>

<p>It was a clear and windless day, and soon we remarked a
characteristic which Murcia exhibited more strongly than
any other Spanish town we have visited. Each house had
exuded its own smell across the pavement, so as one went
along one sampled a variety of Spanish household odours.
Some people find an intimate connection between colour and
smell. We might say that we passed successfully through a
pink smell, a purple smell, a citron green smell, a terra verte
smell (very nasty), a cobalt smell, a raw sienna smell, and so
on. This characteristic clung to Murcia during the greater
part of our stay.</p>

<p>About fifteen minutes' walk through these variegated
odoriferous layers brought us into a street of mean appearance.
The interpreter stopped before a large gateway door, pushed
it open and ushered us into a courtyard in the corner of which
was a black earthenware pot astew over an open fire. A
brown-faced crone, withered with dirt and age, her clothes
ragged, her feet shod in burst alpagatas, asked us what had
brought us there.</p>

<p>"Where is Blas?" said the interpreter.</p>

<p>With an unctuous gesture the old gipsy crone spread out
her hands, and turning to a doorway shouted out some words.
Gipsy women young and old came from the house. They
were dark, dirty and tousled, clad in draggled greys or
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
vermilions, many carrying brown babies astraddle on the hip.
With gestures, almost Indian in subservience, they crowded
about us, looking at us with ill-disguised curiosity. The
interpreter repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Blas," said a young, beautiful, though depressed-looking
woman, "is not in the house."</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i075.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>"The English Señor will speak to him," commanded
the interpreter. "Send him to the hotel when he comes
home."</p>

<p>Then our friend the interpreter determined to earn a large
tip, and calculating on our ignorance brought us back by the
longest route, past all the principal buildings of the town;
thereby quadrupling the journey through the baking streets.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Our desires, however, were fixed on home. We were staggering
beneath the heat. Had the interpreter but known it, his
tip would have been increased by celerity; but, stung by our
apathy over public monuments, he took us into a courtyard
to look at some gigantic tomatoes gleaming in the shade,
and ran us across the street to examine a skein of fine white
catgut, dyed orange at the tips, which a workman was carrying.
He explained that this was for medical operations and
for fishing lines, which was a local industry.</p>

<p>Lunch was ready when we got back, a prolonged and
delicious lunch for those in health, but we could eat little of
it. Black olives were in a dish on the table; and the fruit
included large ripe figs, peaches, pears and apricots. A
curious fact we had noted was that much of the fruit did not
ripen properly. Either it was unripe or else had begun to
rot in the centre. The sun was too strong to allow it to
reach the stage of exquisite ripeness which the more temperate
climate of England encourages. The waiter was dismayed
by our lack of appetite. He urged us repeatedly to further
gastronomic efforts, and holding dishes beneath our noses
stirred up the contents with a fork. At last he made us a
special salad which was not on the menu. The other occupants
of the long white restaurant were all fat men who swallowed
course after course in spite of the heat. We looked at them
and thought: "No wonder there are so many plump people
in Spain."</p>

<p>After coffee in the large hall, we went to our bedroom for
a rest. The windows of our room looked southwards, over
the muddy river. Immediately beneath was a road on which
was a wayside stall of bottles and old ironwork, an ice-cream
vendor, a boy roasting coffee on a stove, turning a
handle round and round while the coffee beans rustled in the
heated iron globe, sending up a delicious smell to our windows.
A row of covered carriages, tartanas, waited beneath the
shadows of the riverside trees. All along the opposite bank
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
were two-storied mills, and beyond them the town stretched
out in a wedge of flat roofs bursting up into church towers.
Green market gardens came up to the edge of the town, and
covered the valley to the base of the hills with a dense growth
of flat and flourishing green which one had not expected thus
far south in Spain.</p>

<p>We were awakened from our siesta by the spherical maid
who mouthed and pantomimed that a Señor was waiting for
us in the hall. Luis Garay, a young painter and lithographer
to whom our friend had written about us, had come at the
earliest opportunity. He was slim, sallow, almost dapper,
with dark frank eyes, and we took a liking to him at once.
Together we went outside the hotel and sat at a table in the
open place facing the principal promenade of Murcia. The
river was on the right-hand side, and on the left was a line
of tall buildings, some cafés, others municipal. The heat
attacked one in waves, it seemed as palpable as though it
possessed substance. When we took our seats the plaza was
empty because the siesta was not yet over, but after four
o'clock had passed gradually the life of the town blossomed
out.</p>

<p>The army of beggars attacked us; in monotonous undertones
they moaned their woes.</p>

<p>"Hermanito, una limosna qui Dios se la pagara,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> they
whined.</p>

<p>To those who seemed unworthy Luis answered, "Dios le
ayude."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>How exquisite is the courtesy of the Spaniard even to a
beggar. Our manners have not this fine habitual touch&mdash;after
the international occupation of Scutari the beggars of
the town had learned two English phrases; one was "G'arn,"
the other "Git away." It is true that under this harsh
exterior the Englishman may hide a soft heart; he may be
like the schoolmaster who feels the caning more poignantly
than does the schoolboy; indeed many a man puts a deliberately
rough exterior on to mask the flabbiness of his sentimental
nature; and the Spaniard, for all his courtesy, may
have the harder nature. Yet the courtesy which recognizes
a common level of humanity is a precious thing. It may be
that by refusing alms with respect one may be preserving in
the beggar finer qualities than would be generated by giving
with contempt. A Spaniard once said, "I like a beggar to
say 'Hermanito, alms which God will repay.' It is naïf and
simple. It has a beauty for which one willingly pays a copper.
But when a beggar whines that he has eaten nothing for three
days, it is offensive. It is an insult to give a man a halfpenny
who has eaten nothing for three days; and one cannot afford
to give him the price of a square meal; and anyhow one
knows that he is lying."</p>

<p>As well as the pitiful beggars there were the musical beggars.
Two men came playing the guitar and laud. Another followed
with a gramophone which he carried from his shoulder by a
strap. Then came the barrel-organ. We had not noted its
arrival. Suddenly the most appalling din broke out. Awhile
ago in Paris M. Marinetti organized a futurist orchestra; one
could imagine that it had been transported in miniature
to Murcia. There were bangs and thumps and crashes of
cymbals, and tattoos of drums, and tinkles of treble notes, and
plonkings of base notes intermixed apparently without order,
rhythm or tune. What a state the barrel must have been in!
Once we presume that it played a tune, but now it was so
decrepit that nothing as such was recognizable. It was
dragged by a donkey and a cart and shepherded by a fat
white dog which had been shaved, partly because of the heat,
partly because of vermin. It was an indecent-looking dog,
and the flesh stood out in rolls all round its joints. No sooner
had this musical horror disappeared round the corner than
another organ in an equal state of disrepair took its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is all right," Luis reassured us; "you have suffered
the worst. There are only two in the town."</p>

<p>A crowd of urchins carrying home-made boot-blacking
boxes pestered us with offers of "Limpia botas." A man and
a woman sauntered between the tables bellowing and screaming
"Les numeros"; these were state lottery sellers.</p>

<p>Also there were sellers of local lotteries, which were
promoted by the Church in aid of the disabled whom they
employed to sell the tickets. Nuns, too, were amongst the
beggars. There were boys selling newspapers; men selling
meringues and pastry, others hawking fried almonds, very salt
to excite thirst; children hunting between the legs of the
tables and chairs for cast cigarette ends or straws discarded
by the drinkers; a man peddling minor toilet articles&mdash;toothpicks,
scent, powder, buttonhooks&mdash;and another with a
basket of very odorous dried fish.</p>

<p>The smell of the fish banished our new-won universal
brotherhood and we waved the fish vender away without
courtesy. But an elegantly dressed young man sitting near
accosted him and began to chaff him. But what was pretence
to the dude was earnest to the salesman. He had some
talent for selling and he pestered the dude for nearly half an
hour, at the end of which the latter in self-defence and for the
sake of peace bought a portion of the smelly commerce.
Probably the fishmonger's total gain out of the transaction
was a fraction of a penny. But the Spanish is not a wasteful
nation. When the dude walked off home he took with him
the fish wrapped in his newspaper.</p>

<p>At last we called the waiter by the Spanish custom of
clapping the hands, paid for the drinks, and guided by Luis
set out to visit the house which our friend had lent us for the
summer. Habits of cleanliness were shown in the streets.
Young girls were hard at work, each industriously brushing
the dust from the sidewalk in front of her house, even though
that sidewalk were itself of dried mud. To us it seemed that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the story was being repeated of the old woman who tried to
besom the tide out of her front door.</p>

<p>Many of the householders had spread their sphere of
influence even beyond the sidewalk, and had soaked their
patch of road, turning the dust into viscous mud. The
pavements were already beginning to be encumbered by
chairs, and by groups of people sitting out in the cooling day.</p>

<p>The Paseo de Corveras is a one-sided street darkened by
tall trees. On the other side stretch maize fields surrounding
a small farm, and walled-in gardens filled with tall feathery
date palms. The dates were already hanging in orange
clusters beneath the sprouting heads of fronds. Luis took us
to the house of Antonio Garrigos, who lived at No. 12.</p>

<p>Antonio was a handsome man of pure Spanish type, giving
an impression of nervous vitality. He produced three keys,
each of about a pound in weight and large as any key of a
theatrical gaoler. The house key was of monstrous size, and
he assured us that we would have to carry it with us wherever
we went. Our friend's apartment at No. 26 was on the first
floor and spread right across two humbler dwellings below.
It was cool and roomy, filled with specimens of Spanish
draperies, pottery and furniture, which he had collected
during several years in Spain. At the back was a kitchen,
with large earthen vessels for water, and Spanish grids for
cooking on charcoal. The bed was big for one, but very small
for two, so we suggested taking off the spring mattress and
laying planks in its place. Antonio at once said that
to-morrow he would get the planks in time for the night.</p>

<p>Then, feeling very tired but thoroughly pleased with our
prospective house, and with the new acquaintances we had
found, we walked back to the hotel, had a supper as liberal
as the lunch, and went to bed</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;SETTLING DOWN</h4>


<p>By the time we left the hotel, which we did on the second
day, the maid had reviewed her decision as to the
state of our mentality. Receiving her tips she shook
our hands warmly, asked where we were going and said that
she would without fail call upon us. The tatterdemalion
bootblack at the hotel door, who could never quite make up
his mind whether he were bootblack or lottery-ticket seller&mdash;neglecting
each business in favour of the other&mdash;helped us
with our luggage. He also on receipt of a tip inquired our
future address and assured us that he would call upon us.
The driver of the tartana told us that he would look us up one
day to see how we were getting on; and another visit was
promised by a ragged lounger whom we called in to aid us
in getting our luggage upstairs.</p>

<p>"Spain," we said, "seems to be a sociable country."</p>

<p>Don Antonio was waiting for us at his house, which was
but a few doors away from our own. He introduced us to
his wife, a buxom, jolly woman of about twenty-five; his
sister, tall, elegant and dark, perhaps the most complete type
of Spanish woman we had yet met; and his brother-in-law.
Don Thomas, for such was the brother-in-law's name, was
able to speak a portion of the American language, and often
by his imperfect knowledge he would deepen our ignorance
of what others were saying in Spanish.</p>

<p>Don Antonio had a small box factory. His house was
two-storied, as were most of the houses in the Paseo. On
the ground floor the front room, or entrada, was filled with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
wood, wood-working benches, and stacks of unfinished boxes;
the kitchen behind was not exempt from business, for here
Antonio made up his glues and pastes, while the whole top
story was occupied by girls who covered the crude shells of
the boxes with velvet and looking-glass and papier mâché
adornments. Antonio and his wife were crowded into two
small rooms, a bedroom in the front alongside of the entrada
and a dining-room at the back parallel with the kitchen.</p>

<p>Our planks were ready for us, but Antonio refused to be
paid for them. He said that when we had finished with them
he could make boxes out of them. We spent the afternoon
in our flat unpacking and arranging the plank bed. The
mattress was not broad enough to cover the planks which
we put down, but we managed to find a padded sofa-covering
which, laid alongside of the mattress, supplemented the
inefficient breadth. As we had met neither mosquitoes nor
net in the hotel, we left the mosquito-net in the trunk.</p>

<p>In the evening Luis Garay called for us. He led us
through a maze of darkened streets, at one time skirting
the tall, over-decorated rococo front of the cathedral, and
brought us to a large doorway within which was a smaller
door. Two sharp raps and the door swung wide mechanically,
though a long rope tied to the latch and looping its way
upstairs showed how it had been opened. Up wide white
stone stairs we went, watched by an old, old man hanging
over the balcony of the second floor. Luis said no word to
him, nor he to Luis.</p>

<p>The chief keynote of Spanish interiors is whiteness. The
room into which we came was white, and out of it was another
white room set with dining-tables and decorated with a huge
white filter. This was "Elias," where we could dine excellently
for the sum of one peseta fifty centimos apiece.</p>

<p>Elias himself looked like a cheery monk painted by Dendy
Sadler. Clad in a long white overall, he stood in the midst
of his snowy tables and greeted us merrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>Luis went away, having said good night, for he had an
engagement. We ate omelet, beefsteak and fried potatoes,
finishing with a plate of fruit, fixed by the multiple stare of
the young men dining there. I was the only woman at
Elias while we dined there, for Spanish women are home clinging
folk, and even to the cafés they never go in large
numbers.</p>

<p>As the young men finished their meals, they went out.
Each one as he passed through the door bowed and said
something. It sounded like "Dobro Vetche," but "Dobro
Vetche" is Serbian for good evening. We could not make
out what the words were, so, as the Serbian seemed to be
appropriate, we boldly answered it in return. Later on we
discovered that they said "Buen Aproveche" with the first
part of the sentence slurred over by habit. It means "May
it do you good," and the customary sentence to say to any
one who is dining. The correct answer is "Gracias."</p>

<p>We left Elias' very satisfied with our cheap discovery.
Jan, who generally has a good head for locality, engaged to
find his way back without a guide. But he turned the wrong
way out of Elias' door. We wandered amongst deep darkened
streets till suddenly we came out into one as narrow
as the others, but laid with flat pavements, instead of rugged
cobbles, and blazing with light. Through this we ran the
gauntlet of Murcia. The street was crowded with hotels
and cafés, both sides being lined with tables at which the
evening drinkers were sitting. The street itself was filled
with a flux and reflux of the youth and beauty, the
"Hooventud, Bellitza and Looho,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of the town.</p>

<p>We came, especially I, upon them as a catastrophe.
The light died out of their eyes, the smiles disappeared from
their faces, mouths dropped open, fingers pointed, people
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
grasped each other. It was similar to the moment when an
elephant comes along in the village circus procession, and I
was the elephant.</p>

<p>During our first weeks in Murcia our appearance in the
streets invariably caused excitement and shrieks of laughter
among young girls and gossips. If we entered a shop the
children crowded in with us to listen to our attempts at Spanish.
This was not done with deliberate rudeness, but was more
the result of unrestrained curiosity. This attitude was not
very evident when we went for strolls with Luis: the presence
of a fellow-townsman seemed to have a calming influence.
At last I found an effective weapon. With mock horror I
stared at the feet and ankles of any young woman too
malicious. Self-consciousness at once gripped her&mdash;almost
invariably she hurried away to examine her shoes and wonder
what was wrong with them.</p>

<p>Curiously enough we never became conscious of a case of
incivility among the men. Even groups of lads at the difficult
age which breeds larrikins in Australia were on the whole less
offensive than in other countries. It seemed to us that if a
Spanish woman were kind-hearted&mdash;and the majority are
so&mdash;she was the most kindly and charming of women, but if
of a spiteful nature she took less pains to hide or curb it than
do the women of more sophisticated countries.</p>

<p>The narrow street which we had discovered by accident
was perhaps the most disconcerting part of the town, as it
was full of cafés, and therefore of loungers; but we often had
to go there for small necessities. There we had to go for
smoked glasses because of the brilliance of the sun, for a
parasol, and for a hatpin. The first two objects were easily
found, but the last was difficult. Hats, even in Southern Spain,
are worn only by the <i>crème de la crème</i> for great ceremonies,
and the hatpins sold by the jewellers were intended for such
occasions. They were decorated affairs with huge heads of
complicated workmanship set with garish stones. Probably
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
no other woman in the town wore a hat for normal use, so
we gave up the search and Jan made out of hairpins something
which served.</p>

<p>We ran the gauntlet of the quizzing street and made our
way home.</p>

<p>All along the streets the people had brought their chairs
out of doors and were sitting on the pavements in the cool
of the night. At Antonio's door we found a group of his
family, almost invisible in the dark. We sat down with them.
Presently Antonio said:</p>

<p>"I will go and fetch Don Luis, and he will play for us."</p>

<p>What then could be seen of Don Luis was a large nose,
a check cap and a pair of gnarled hands which grasped his
guitar in a capable manner. He sat down on a chair on the
sidewalk and began to play.</p>

<p>"Curse it!" he exclaimed. "Do you know I used to
play very well, but all this factory work ruins the fingers for
playing. Mine are getting as stiff as if they had no joints
in them."</p>

<p>Presently he was playing a jota and demanded that
somebody should dance.</p>

<p>"Dance, dance!" he shouted. "Curse it! What's the
good of playing if nobody dances?"</p>

<p>By this time most of the inhabitants of the houses near
had gathered round, although almost hidden; but there were
no young men. Antonio's sister danced a jota with a pretty
girl. The jota is the most common of Spanish dances, as
the waltz used to be with us. It has a <i>tempo</i> which fluctuates
between three-four and two-four, the phrases being divided
into two beats each or three bars of two beats each at the will
of the player. The jota that evening appeared to be a very
sedate kind of dance. When it was over the crowd urged us
to dance something English. We asked Don Luis to play the
jota again, and to it we danced a rather mad waltz which
we had invented. The path upon which we danced was of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
dried mud, which is pounded into unusual shapes in the
winter and dries in whatever shape it happens to be when
the heat comes. It was full of lumps and holes, and the
light was dim. In a moment we partially understood why
Antonio's sister had been so sedate. But the brother-in-law
informed us:</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "my girl can dance wonderful. But
't'aint proper, in de town. Say, you see 'er in de country.
Den she hop. She kick de window in wid 'er toe. Sure.
Show you one day."</p>

<p>Murcia is a town of about 100,000 inhabitants and is the
capital of its province, but it is hardly more than an overgrown
village in spite of its cathedral, its bullring, its theatre and
its cinema palace. Both at Avila and at Madrid they had
said to us: "Aha, you are going to the town of the beautiful
women!"</p>

<p>But the women of Murcia, with the exception of some
lovely and filthy gipsies, were not unusually beautiful. They
were thick-set and useful looking with muscular necks and
ankles, and their eyes had a domesticated expression. Their
clothes emphasized their defects. They indulged in pastel
shades and frills which were used in fantastic ways. We have
seen frills in spiral twisting around the frock from neck to
hem, or a series of jaunty inverted frills round the hips,
which gave to the wearer something of the appearance of
one of those oleographs of a maiden half emerging from the
calyx of a flower: or perpendicular frills which made the
wearer resemble a cog-wheel.</p>

<p>We had ample opportunities of observing them from the
windows of our house, at which we started our experimental
sketches in Spain, but we had to sit back from the balcony
because small crowds began to gather, and boys to shout.
Antonio then said that he would take us to one of the big
walled-in gardens where we could paint at our ease.</p>

<p>A huge gateway led into a courtyard which was completely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
covered by a vine pergola. The grapes hung in large bunches,
though yet green. At one side of the courtyard was a low
stall on which fruit and vegetables were for sale, and near an
arched door a woman was washing clothes in a large basin of
antique pattern. The garden was a rich mass of green.
Huge trees of magnolia were covered with waxy white flowers
and gave out a strong odour which scented the wide garden.
Lemon trees and orange trees were ranged in rows; the
lemons yellow on the trees or lying on the ground as thick
as fallen apples after an autumn storm, the oranges still
hard spheres of dark green. Along the edges of the paths
stood up the tall palm trees with their golden clusters of
unripe dates, or with their fronds tied up in a stiff spike,
some mystery of palm cultivation. Fronds of palm, hacked
from off the trees, lay about the ground, and we were surprised
to find by experience that they possessed long, piercing
and painful thorns.</p>

<p>We painted for several days in this small paradise, but
our conscience was accusing us. We had not come to Spain
to paint gardens. One day we took our courage in our hands.</p>

<p>"It is market day," said we; "we will go and paint the
market."</p>

<p>Peasant carts loaded with fruit and vegetables were
crowding into the town; men clad in black cottons were
dragging donkeys, upon the backs of which were panniers
filled with saleable provisions; women with umbrellas aloft
against the sun carried baskets in their arms or heavy packages
upon their hips. The market was spread in the sunlight
behind the Hôtel Reina Victoria. Grain was for sale in
broad, flat baskets, cheap cottons were on stalls; fruits&mdash;peaches,
plums, and lemons&mdash;were mixed with tomatoes,
berenginas, and red or green peppers. To one side of the
market place was the fonda which had once been a monastery.
This was for the travellers by road as the hotels were for
travellers by rail. In a huge arched entrada carters and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
villagers were sitting at their ease. To one side was a
kitchen in which could be seen large red earthen vessels
which made one think of the last scene in "The Forty
Thieves," and beyond the entrada was an open courtyard
in which the high tilted road waggons were drawn up in
rows.</p>

<p>Skirting the fonda wall I found a corner which seemed
secluded, and sitting down I began to paint an old woman
and her fruit stall. One by one a few people gathered behind
me. Blas, the gipsy musician, came up, greeted me, and
added his solid presence to the spectators. A baker came
out of his shop and watched. The crowd began to increase.
Soon they were pressing all round, even in front, so that I
could see nothing.</p>

<p>"I cannot paint if I cannot see," I exclaimed to Blas.</p>

<p>He and the baker set themselves one on each side and
hustled an opening in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Atras, atras!" they shouted. "En la cola, en la
cola."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>But more and more people hurried up to see what was
happening. Soon the crowd, despite the strenuous efforts of
Blas and the baker, closed up again in front, and no efforts
could keep an open vista.</p>

<p>Jan, who had been drawing in another part of the market,
came up. He saw in the midst of a maelstrom of heads the
extreme tip of my hat and worked his way through, to speaking
distance. Brown-faced old women, with market baskets,
men with turkeys hung in braces over their shoulders, young
women with babies, gipsy men with tall hats and gig-whips,
noisy boys, all smiling, friendly and curious, were peeping
under my hat discussing the phenomenon.</p>

<p>We left the disappointed maelstrom, which changed its
shape and followed us like a rivulet to a café, where they
stood for a while gazing solemnly while we sipped iced coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>We then decided that sketching in the streets of Murcia was
not to be thought of. Luis, to whom we confided this, said
that he would find us balconies and roofs from which we
could work, but we wanted to settle in some small village
where we could know everybody in a day, and sketch where
we liked, so Luis made arrangements to take us across the
plain at the foot of the mountains to see some villages that
might suit us</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;BLAS</h4>


<p>Spain is the true home of the guitar. Only in Spain is
the guitar&mdash;the most complete of solo instruments&mdash;heard
in its true perfection. But even in Spain the
cult of the guitar is dying out. Nowadays, at marriages,
births or christenings the guitar is no longer inevitable, for
the cheap German piano and the gramophone are ousting
the national instrument. Jan had become enamoured of the
guitar in Paris, some small progress he had made with the
help of a friend; but one cannot get the true spirit of Spanish
music at second hand. So Blas, the gipsy, was called in to
given him instruction.</p>

<p>We had been told not to give Blas more than twenty
pesetas a month, these to be full payment for a daily lesson.
However, Blas proved to be more adept at bargaining than
we were. He looked very Egyptian in the face, was very
smart in a grey check suit, patent leather boots and straw
hat, a strange contrast to the poverty of his home and the
slatterns of women who were his family and relations. He
came in rubbing his hands together, grinning with an expanse
of strong, white teeth, and showing a sly expression in his
curious eyes. He cringed to us.</p>

<p>He demanded two pesetas a lesson, or sixty pesetas a
month. We held out that we had been told to offer him
twenty. This, he answered, was impossible, quite impossible,
out of the question. Some of his subserviency was immediately
put into his pocket. Jan said that as he would be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
painting a good deal he would not want more than three
lessons a week. Blas hummed and hawed and chewed the
idea for a while. Then, with the air of one who is making a
great concession, he said that since it was the Señor and
since he appeared "muy sympatico" he would consent to
take twenty-five pesetas, and that was his final offer. Jan
agreed. Blas then added that he was reducing his terms
solely because of the sympathetic nature of the Señor, and
that he was by no means satisfied with the bargain, and that
it was "muy poco." He then asked Jan if he had a guitar.
Jan said that he was using the big white instrument made
by Ramirez which our friend had left in his house. Blas
answered that he possessed the brother of that instrument
himself, and that it was a good one.</p>

<p>Only after he had gone did we realize that three lessons
a week meant twelve lessons a month, and, at his original
price, this would have amounted to twenty-four pesetas,
and that Bias had wheedled out a peseta more than his
original offer.</p>

<p>We do not like the bargaining system which is prevalent
all over Spain, a habit from which, in spite of their stern
notices, the "precio fijo" shops are not quite exempt. We
are not registering this objection because Blas cozened us
of a peseta; but it seems to us that the whole habit of chaffering
inculcates a lack of generosity and lays a foundation of
unfriendly relationships between people. No matter upon
what friendly terms the bargaining is carried out, too much
of an element of positive personal competition is brought in;
but much bargaining is not carried on in a friendly way.
It also necessitates a wholesale campaign of lying&mdash;appreciative
and depreciative&mdash;on the part of both buyer and
seller, and a certain amount of personal feeling on the side
of the loser. Nor does the constant simulation of anger tend
to make a person more pacific by habit. Curiously enough
the most generous man is often the worst treated by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
bargaining system. He offers a sum in excess of the real
value in order to shorten the ordeal, and by doing so only
excites the seller to greater cupidity. We have noted that
the successful bargainer is treated with respect, while the
other who cuts short the bargain by paying too much earns
contempt.</p>

<p>Blas came to our house at about twelve o'clock. He was
a true musician and lived&mdash;as far as we could discover&mdash;for
but two things, music and drink. He had seemed to understand
our Spanish well enough to get the better of the
bargain, but he had forgotten this. He, like the maid, had
a fixed idea that Jan could not speak Spanish. He grinned,
and made strange noises, but never tried to explain anything
by means of words. One cannot say that he was a good
teacher. All that he could do was to play a piece over and
over again, and trust you to get it by ear. Now and again
he would grasp Jan's fingers and try to force them into the
necessary positions. He was even incapable of playing his
tunes slowly. If Jan wished to analyse a movement which
came in the middle of a melody Blas had to begin at the
beginning. Sometimes Jan was almost in despair, but he
worked hard and in the end drew a profit out of Blas's
inadequate instruction.</p>

<p>Spanish guitar music is unlike the music of Europe. It
has a strange primitive character depending for its marvellous
rhythmic properties upon a rhythm of phrase more than
upon the rhythm of the bar division. The form is simple, a
passage played with the back of the nails across the strings,
called the "Rasgueado," a passage like a refrain or chorus,
"the Paseo," in reality the introduction of the dance or
melody, and the melodies proper called "Falsetas." The
rhythmic structure which does not correspond to the bar
division of the music is usually emphasized by drum taps
made upon the sound board of the guitar with the nail of
the second finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Blas considered it his duty to teach Jan two falsetas on
each visit.</p>

<div align="center">

    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i093.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>But if he was a bad teacher, he was a fine player. Resting
his chin on the great guitar as if the passage of the vibrations
through his body were a source of pleasure, he crouched,
looking like something between a bullfrog and a Cheshire cat.</p>

<p>Then with supple fingers he played, drawing delicious
melodies; or rasping with his nails he beat out complex
harmonies that seemed to vie with an orchestra in richness of
sound.</p>

<p>When he came to a falseta, he would throw up his negroid
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
eyes like a Greco saint, he would kiss his hand, and, as likely
as not, spit on the floor to emphasize his delight.</p>

<p>Before he left the house he always tried to get an advance
upon his salary. After all, to him we were only <i>Busné</i> to be
fleeced if possible. But when his indebtedness amounted to
the whole of his month's pay we fended him off by saying
that we had no change.</p>

<p>I do not think we realized how much we were overpaying
Blas until we decided to leave Murcia. We found a house,
as you will hear, at Verdolay about five miles away. When
he heard that we were leaving, Blas volunteered to come out
as usual for the same pay. He said that he would cheerfully
walk the distance&mdash;ten miles&mdash;for that money. But we were
getting rather shy of Blas. He was too persistent a borrower
for our slender means and we had heard of other teachers
who were cheaper. So we took this opportunity and dropped
him as a pilot to the guitar</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;THE ALPAGATA SHOP</h4>


<p>Save upon feast days, and with the exception of the
nobility, who are few, and of the merchants, who have
to be worldly commonplace, alpagatas, or string-soled
shoes, are the footwear of the Spanish nation. If you dodge
the big towns you may go for days and never see a boot.
The agricultural labourer, the artisan, the beggar, the soldier,
the engine-driver, the porters all wear either the alpagata or,
in the summer, its cooler brother, the string-soled sandal.
In Spain boots are not meant for real wear, you swagger
around the town in boots, and have them cleaned four or five
times a day. At a café a horde of bootblacks precipitate
themselves towards you to renew the lustre&mdash;possibly dimmed
by the all-prevalent dust&mdash;of those foot ornaments. The
young man who goes to meet his <i>novía</i> removes his alpagatas,
and puts on boots highly polished and with check tops; the
young maiden who is sitting out with her <i>novio</i> has placed
her alpagatas in the corner and stretches high-heeled shoes
across the pavement. But for all-day-up-and-down use the
alpagata wins every time; the baby wears alpagatas, and its
grandmother wears a larger variant; there are white alpagatas,
brown alpagatas, grey alpagatas, black alpagatas for those
in mourning&mdash;a very important ceremony in Spain&mdash;and
there are the elaborate, almost Eastern, alpagatas, entirely
of esparto grass, the making of which occupies the time when
the goatherd is not yelling at his goats. Even the horsemen,
the caballeros, often wear alpagatas. It is true that one
cannot strap a spur on to an alpagata, but on the whole
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
spurs are little used in Spain. If the rider wishes his horse
or donkey to mend his pace, he thumps the animal with a
thick cudgel at about the place where St. Dunstan kicked the
devil.</p>

<p>The alpagata is also a cheap form of footwear. Those
which we were wearing cost three pesetas, say 2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> They
should last two months. We were therefore spending 1<i>s.</i> 4-1/2<i>d.</i>
a month each on shoes. A little arithmetic will show this as
16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a year. To-day boots alone cost more than this in
repairs, not counting the first cost. For children, of course,
they are unrivalled, as the life of the alpagata almost fits the
growth of the infant, which is spared the torture one remembers
in childhood of boots which were too good to throw away
and yet too small to wear with ease. But to taste the full
romantic flavour of the alpagata, it should have been bought
in the true alpagata shop. If you are in Spain don't go to
the boot-shop. It does sell alpagatas, but it ought not to
do so. In Spain the boot-seller should be classed with the
jeweller. He sells ornaments. The boot merchant who
sells alpagatas in Spain is as bad as the jeweller here who
sells umbrellas. Go to the shop which sells things for the
road, for that picturesque, coloured, moving life of Spain.
The doorway of this fascinating shop is piled up with bales
of a rough cloth of an exquisite hyacinthine blue, or of a
strange yellow, which is seen to perfection only in the alpagata
shop or in El Greco's pictures. This cloth is used for lining
horse-collars and saddles. Above these beautiful bales are
collars of white leather, heavy with small cone-shaped bells
of copper, for the goats, larger collars of brown leather, either
with small bells in rows, like a lady's pearl collar, or with
one large bell pendant, for the oxen. Within are large
coronet-shaped semicircles of leather and coloured woolwork,
red, yellow, black, white, for the oxen's foreheads, long
ribbons of coloured woolwork for the donkeys' harness, and
fringes of brightly coloured wool netting, ending in tassels,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
like that which decorated the under edge of our grandmothers'
sofas, to hang across the donkey's chest or down his nose.
Muzzles for goats and for donkeys are here too. There is
harness also in the shop, Gargantuan-looking harness studded
with nails, so broad in its facets of leather that when the
horse has his face inside it he looks not unlike an ancient
knight in his armour. Only his eyes and his mouth are
visible, and often indeed not the latter, for it may be guarded
by a piece of leather work not unlike the tongue of a brogue
shoe.</p>

<p>Talking of shoes brings us back to the alpagata. A man
will be working at a table like a butcher's block. Deftly he
cuts the rope, bending it around an iron peg into the shape of
the sole, then with a long awl he pierces it through and
through, sewing it with great rapidity, and almost hey presto!
as it were, a pair of soles are finished. Women who sit almost
on the edge of the street, chattering and gossiping&mdash;often
with the passers-by&mdash;are making the uppers of stout canvas.
They spring from work to serve you with a gracious kindliness,
and seeing that you are English they probably with the same
gracious kindliness clap an extra fifty centimos on to the
price. If only we had such an alpagata shop in London what
a rush there would be to purchase.</p>

<p>Your old alpagatas you leave behind you. What happens
to them is to us a mystery. Old boots are the nuisance of
the London dust heaps, the terror of the errant mongrel.
Yorick, who, Sam Weller assures us, is the only person
who has ever seen a dead donkey, may also in his travels
have seen an extinct alpagata, but his "Sentimental Journey"
is unfinished and we shall never know</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;BRAVO TORO</h4>


<p>Along cool colonnades of raw-coloured brick, up a
staircase arched with concrete, and out through a sort
of concrete culvert which spouted humanity, we came
into the huge round amphitheatre of the bullring. Owing
to Spanish dilatoriness, we were later than we had intended,
and in consequence were unable to get seats within the
coveted shadow which lay over half the great enclosure;
but, thank goodness, the sky was mottled with clouds which
tempered both the heat and the glare of the Spanish afternoon.
We were in the cheapest seats, having disdained to go
skywards into the boxes, for we had come to taste the full
flavour of an average bullfight as a popular spectacle, and we
wished it as pure as possible. So we had bought purple
tickets for two pesetas and a white one for me at half price;
at the same time repelling the persistence of a feminine hawker,
who pressed upon us large flabby looking paper bags of
mysterious content which we imagined to be some form of
refreshment. The seats of the bullring were of flat stone
rising tier upon tier, and we chose our places low down to
get a good view, yet as near as possible to the slowly creeping
shadow; only one row of stone seats and two rows of chairs
of iron lattice separated us from the arena itself. The chairs
were empty, so I asked Luis if they were reserved for some
special purpose. "No," he answered, "but the bull may
leap out of the ring." Those chairs would entangle him, but
it is uncomfortable if you happen to be sitting there, so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
they are not very popular." As the edge of the arena was
guarded by a palisade of stout planking about five feet high,
through which were cut narrow gaps&mdash;bolt-holes&mdash;for the
toreadors, and the seats were separated from this palisade
by a passage some six feet wide, the lowest seats being set
some ten feet above the floor, I felt that the risk of finding
an enraged bull in one's lap was rather remote.</p>

<p>The culverts spouted Spanish humanity: soldiers in
greenish khaki; women in black, white or colours dominated
by a very popular pink; peasants in blue blouses and sandals;
bourgeoisie in straw hats and drill; youths in caps of exaggerated
English cut. Immediately below us two small
children, mothered by a third aged about eleven, all three
exceedingly unkempt, rather dirty, and possibly verminous,
took their seats, and, recognizing that I was a stranger,
advised me in hoarse whispers all through the progress of
the spectacle. In spite of her obvious poverty the eldest
girl wore a large tortoise-shell comb of elaborate pattern in a
carefully arranged <i>coiffure</i>. Numberless children seemed to
have attended the spectacle thus, as the small Londoners go
to the cinema. At this moment the ring itself was full
of them, some playing football, a game very popular&mdash;there
is even a Spanish periodical called <i>Free-Kick</i>&mdash;others
giving imitation exhibitions of bullfighting, more or less like
that played by the children in the hotel. When the imitation
bull, stabbed to death, was dragged around the ring,
the real spectators cheered loudly. We wondered what the
bull's mother would say about the state of his pants.</p>

<p>This was no Mantilla day, nor day of fiesta. It was just
an ordinary Sunday afternoon diversion in this provincial
town. We took our first dose of bullfight in this place for a
reason. Essentially a popular sport should be judged as a
sport of the people: not by its highest exponents, but by
its average. An intelligent foreigner would not get the
truest impression of what cricket means to England at Lord's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
or at the Oval; but on some village green at an inter-parochial
contest.</p>

<p>The horrors of bullfighting began with a band, the age of the
bandsmen varying between fourteen and seventy years. The
band marched around the ring playing music as out of tune as
the new age is with the old. The ring emptied of children,
and two horsemen superbly mounted dashed across the arena
to demand from the President the key of the bull-pen. This
was followed by a general parade of the toreros. Alas, for
romance! Their gilt was somewhat tarnished, most of their
cloaks worn and faded; usually the only part of the costume
which seemed to have retained its original brilliance was the
coloured seat of the tight trousers, which I suppose comes in
for very little wear and tear. The picadors with their nail-headed
lances seemed veritable Don Quixotes on their more
than Rosinante steeds: poor beasts doomed to the knackers
anyhow. The procession ended with two cart-horses and a
yoke destined to drag the slaughtered bulls from the ring.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Luis said in a low murmur:</p>

<p>"Doesn't your heart beat? Isn't this moment exciting?"</p>

<p>He spoke truly. Around the huge oval all eyes were concentrated
on the red door of the bull-pen: the very air seemed
rarefied and electric. For me, I think this was the most
tense moment of the day: that moment before anything had
happened. A bugle call cut the silence. The red door swung
open and with a peculiar rolling gallop the bull dashed into
the arena.</p>

<p>"Now," I thought, "this terrible bullfight, about which
so much has been written, so much discussed, has indeed
begun."</p>

<p>The bullfights of our imagination are spectacles of sun
and colour&mdash;of madness stained with cruelty; the cruelty
perhaps partly condoned by the fierceness of the bull, by a sort
of wild frenzy of sport which seems in some part to excuse
the murderous instinct of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

  </table>
</div>

<p>The bull, a coloured rosette nailed to its shoulder, reached
the centre of the ring, and then, for me, half the anticipated
interest of the fight vanished. We had expected a wild and
furious gallop around the arena; a bull lusting to kill or be
killed; mad charges at the toreros, who would elude it with
quick baffling passes of the cloaks, wild dashes at the unfortunate
horses, the riders of which would at least make some
pretence of manœuvering before the furious bull was allowed
to fling horse and rider into the air. But no! The bull
slowed up, halted and looked to this side and that. It was
obviously perplexed. One could almost imagine a crease of
puzzlement between its eyes. What was all this; where the
sierras of its youth; into what strange place had it come?
And now began a taunting of the unwilling bull. The toreros
flapped their faded cloaks at it, but whenever the bull was
tempted to charge the man ran for safety and crammed
himself through one of the bolt-holes in the palisade&mdash;once a
torero scampering for life reached an opening at the same
instant as a companion. For a moment there was a flurry,
but both men contrived to push through before the bull was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
able to reach them. The first impression of the fight was of
a certain power and some magnificence on the part of the
bull, and of degradation on the part of the toreros&mdash;one
thought of the shorn Sampson taunted by the Philistines.
In this contest the men seemed somehow ignoble in comparison
with the animals. The next act of the drama made
this feeling no better. The picador was led out on his blindfolded
and skeleton-like steed by a little man in a red shirt,
who from behind the horse's head held out, like a policeman
regulating the traffic, a protesting hand at the bull, as if to
imply that the animal was not to charge till he was ready
to bolt. For some while the bull did not take the invitation,
though whenever he appeared likely to do so the small
man dropped the reins and ran for the paling, from which,
however, he took care never to be very far away. The
picador himself is not in great danger, for his trousers are
armour plated.</p>

<p>By this time the audience was shouting out: "No
quiere!"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but at last the bull charged, the picador thrust
his lance, and the bull with a great thrust of its head overturned
both horse and man. Immediately the bull was surrounded
by the toreros who with flapping cloaks distracted
its attention. Man and horse were lifted up again.</p>

<p>Large numbers of Spaniards do not like bullfighting, but
a great many Spaniards who do not in principle object to
bullfighting do object to the horse-slaughter. One, cutting
to the roots of the truth, said it was "not æsthetic." He
was right. There should be a strong sense of the æsthetic in
sport&mdash;it is a thing more subtle than mere "fair play," and
when this sense of the æsthetic is ignored the sport becomes
brutality. This horse-slaughter more than oversteps the line
of the æsthetic, so for us did the bolt-holes provided for the
toreros. For us bullfighting would begin to be a serious sport
if the men and the bull stood on the same conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

</div>

<p>One picador, who by means of his lance kept the bull off
from his horse, received a round of well-earned applause.
The bugle sounded once more and the picadors were led out
of the ring. There followed another rather dull interval of
cloak-flapping. One of the matadors, however, gave an exhibition
of passes which made the bull charge repeatedly within a
foot or so of the man's body, during which the torero did not
move his feet. When the bull, baffled and panting with
exhaustion at his fruitless tosses, paused, the torero went
upon one knee before the animal. The spectators shrieked
applause and flung their hats into the ring. But this exhibition
was very different from the usual cloak-flapping followed
by a scamper for the bolt-hole: nor, indeed, was it shown
often.</p>

<p>A torero who had carried an exceedingly faded violet cloak,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and who had been perhaps most hasty in his dashes for the
safety gaps, now discarded his cloak, and waving a pair of
pink banderillas stepped into the centre of the ring. Like
a foreigner at cricket we naturally missed much of the
subtlety, but it was obvious that there were certain conditions
under which the banderillero would meet the bull and others
under which he would not. When the toreador seemed to
think the bull in a good position, he waved his banderillas and
stamped his feet as though about to fence. But the bull
did not want banderillas stuck into him. Again and again
he declined the invitation while the populace howled "No
quiere, no quiere!" Personally I should have sent the bull
home and ordered another with more ginger in it. At last,
exasperated, the bull charged, the banderillero ran towards it
in a slightly circular path, planted his two sticks, each some
thirty inches long, into the bull's neck, and, curving out more
widely, avoided by a few inches the upward thrust of the
bull's horns. This piece of work looked dangerous, and the
pay of a banderillero amounts to between £3 and £4 an afternoon.
I think that he earns his money. What surprised us
was to see the torero who had appeared such a scamperer
with the faded purple cloak performing most pluckily with
the paper-covered sticks. I suppose it is the case of a good
batsman and good bowler&mdash;the arts are not interchangeable.</p>

<p>The six banderillas having been placed, another interval
of harrying the unfortunate animal with minor exasperations
of cloak-flapping followed: but at last the espatero, the swordsman,
and the matador prepared to give the death stroke. Here
again in first-class bullfighting probably the whole exhibition
is one of supreme skill. We expected a certain number of
showy passes with the scarlet flag, the matador keeping the
bull circling about him&mdash;"wearing the bull as a waist-belt,"
as the saying is in Spain. Then a pause, a sudden thrust
with the sword&mdash;and, with a groan, the bull is dead. It was
not so. The espatero walked about flapping the cloak, at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
which sometimes the bull did charge, but more often did not.
Several times the espatero had to run into a bolt-hole. The
bull showed strong desires to go home: it went to the side
of the ring and looked at the door from whence it had emerged,
while more venturesome members of the audience leaned over
the palisade and tried to snatch out a banderilla as a souvenir.
The toreador chivied the bull round the ring, trying to get it
face foremost. However, when he succeeded in this he did
not seem satisfied, for though the people yelled: "Ahora!
Ahora!"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the matador only flapped his cloak.</p>

<p>"He is rather a nervous espatero," said Luis, "so, when
he does prepare to kill, look out. Sometimes the sword flies.
Not very long ago it landed in the audience and killed a
spectator." At last, however, the bull, tongue hanging out,
foam dripping from its mouth, blood streaming from the
lance and banderilla wounds in the shoulders, faced the
matador with half lowered and sullen head. The matador,
taking up the position of a man about to throw a javelin,
aimed his sword, which was curiously curved in the blade,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>and with quick steps ran in, thrust, and side-stepped. The
bull, taken by surprise, could not bring its weight into action
rapidly enough, the upward tossing horns missed the man
by inches: the bull rushed forward at another torero who had
taken position in line to attract the animal's attention. The
matador had made no master stroke, the sword stood eighteen
inches out of the bull's shoulder. The bull showed no signs
of death, so the matador went away to procure another sword.
Finally the bull, stabbed by four swords, was worried to death
rather than killed, after which the corpse was dragged
triumphantly around the ring at the tail of the team of
horses, while the spectators stood on the stone seats and
cheered.</p>

<p>It may be that we English take our pleasures sadly, but
at that moment it struck me that at an ordinary bullfight
the Spaniard seems to take rather dull pleasures with
ecstasy.</p>

<p>The second bull proved more lively, the second matador
more expert, or more lucky than his confrère; but here also
the show seemed to partake rather of the nature of what
should properly be termed bull-baiting than bullfighting. This
second bull provided the thrill of the day to the three small
dirty children. With one thrust of its horn it killed a horse.
The small boy (aged six or seven) turned to me with eyes
sparkling with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" he exclaimed. "One thrust only."</p>

<p>After the death of this bull came the Interval.</p>

<p>"Look up the numbers printed on your tickets," said
Luis.</p>

<p>Having found the papers, I raised my head and to my
amazement saw, in the centre of the arena, a donkey, two
young calves and a sewing-machine.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I exclaimed. "What are those?"</p>

<p>"They are the prizes of the tombola," explained Luis;
"you or the Señor may win one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>The lots were drawn out of a large hat-box, and the
numbers displayed on a blackboard. The donkey fell to a
small boy, the calves to a peasant. But for some while the
sewing-machine, forlorn and incongruous, stood in the centre
of the bloodthirsty arena awaiting a claimant. Attention
was finally concentrated upon a point high up amongst the
cheap seats, to the right of the President's box. Shouting,
persuasion, hand-clapping and arm-waving ensued, and at last
the crowd squeezed out a small, dark woman, blushing and
giggling behind her fan, accompanied by husband, husband's
friend and six-year-old son. The sewing-machine was
escorted out of the same door through which the dead bulls
had been dragged.</p>

<p>Then the bullfight began again. The third bull, a lusty
black, was the most willing of all. He did charge, he leapt
high in his endeavours to kill those phantom cloaks. After
all the necessary banderillas had been placed, there followed
an incident. A boy of about sixteen years leapt the barrier
and ran across the ring, hastily as he ran unwrapping something
from a covering of newspaper. There was a sudden
hum of excited voices from the spectators.</p>

<p>"Ei!" cried Luis. "An amateur!"</p>

<p>The boy reached the President's box, the unwrapped
objects being a pair of dirty banderillas. Bowing to the
President he craved permission to plant his banderillas in the
bull. But, alas for youthful aspirations, permission was not
given. The boy clambered sadly over the palisade to hide
himself in the audience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this bull, the bravest of the four, fell to
the lot of the nervous matador. Death was a very lengthy
operation, during the progress of which the bull knocked down
the bullfighter. For a moment we wondered if the bull were
going to take its revenge, but flapping cloaks instantly distracted
it. Meanwhile, between the forelegs of the bull the
matador lay very still, shielding his head with his arms. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
nervous matador, however, went on with his task, using three
swords before it was completed.</p>

<p>The matador of the fourth bull made an exceedingly bad
thrust. The populace howled insults at him, flinging at the
same time those paper bags which we had seen on sale near the
ticket-office. They contained no refreshment, nor material
for bombarding unsuccessful matadors, but were stuffed with
horsehair to soften the stone seats. By this time we wished
we had inquired more about them, for the stone had proved
anything but soft. The fourth bull dead, the bullfight was
over.</p>

<p>"Come and see the toreros," said Luis.</p>

<p>So with the outflowing press we repassed into the culvert,
down the stairs and along the corridors of brick, till we
reached a window or grille, by staring through which we could
see the "heroes of Spain" clambering into an ordinary station
bus, in which they sat, stiff, cramped, dignified and unsmiling,
conscious of their importance.</p>

<p>We returned with the returning crowds along the roads
deep in dust, back to the centre of the town where there were
cooling drinks and seats softer than those stone benches.
While we were sitting thus, revelling in varied positions and
summing up our first impressions, a large box cart of lattice
work passed by. Within the cart were hung great joints of
meat which swung to and fro as the cart bumped over the
uneven road.</p>

<p>"There," said Luis, "go the bulls. They will be sold
to-morrow in the market. The meat is cheap because it is
rather tough."</p>

<p>This incident, because it seemed to contain a note of
irony, because it had in it something sardonic and something
callous, seemed to us a fitting termination to the spectacle
which we had witnessed</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h4>AN EXCURSION</h4>


<p>Murcia was very hot, very dusty and very sultry.
We did not mind mere heat&mdash;though Spanish midsummer
heat was not the best of pick-me-ups for the
influenza&mdash;dust we could outlive, but the sultriness of the
Murcian valley was beyond our physique. This flat valley,
which is ten miles wide between abrupt mountains, is irrigated
over the whole of its breadth and is one of the richest
agricultural parts of Spain. The evaporation of the water
makes the heat of Murcia damp; the summer in addition was
cloudy, and the sun shining on to the clouds seemed to cook
the air enclosed in the valley until the atmosphere resembled
that of a glass-house for orchids. We wished to leave Murcia
in spite of an affection which was growing in us for the town.</p>

<p>Luis met us at one o'clock on the terrace of the Reina
Victoria. We had <i>café au lait</i> while waiting for the tartana.
Luis said that the milk in the coffee was not good: he deduced
preservatives. But the lean waiter stood loyally by his
hotel.</p>

<p>"The milk is excellent, I assure you, Señor," he said.
"My stomach is excessively delicate; the slightest thing and
it is ... I assure you that I drink pints of this milk in this
hotel. In fact my stomach is so delicado that I am a connoisseur
in milk, es vero.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> If the milk were bad this fatality
would happen to me."</p>

<p>He gave a dumb-crambo exhibition of the results of bad
milk on his delicate digestion; it needed no words.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>With deference he then proposed a new <i>café au lait</i>, which
Luis sipped with a judicial but unconvinced manner.</p>

<p>The tartana was a tight fit. It is about as large as a
governess-cart inside, and we were six. Luis, Jan and
myself, a monk in brown, a thin pale Señor who had long
eyelashes and many rings, and another passenger, a world
type, the result of overwork and underpay, neither smart
nor slovenly, with a rough manner covering a kindly nature.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Drive</span></p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i110.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>

  </table>
</div>

<p>We discovered why tartanas have bulging hoods. The
vehicles roll and rock so much over the bad roads that it is
necessary to make room for the passengers' heads to jerk
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
backwards. Otherwise cerebral concussion would be the
invariable result.</p>

<p><i>Luis</i> (to the little monk): "Excuse me, but are not your
clothes very hot?"</p>

<p><i>The Monk</i> (spreading out his hands): "They are hot, but
nevertheless they keep out the sun."</p>

<p>We come out of the town into the gardens. There are
flat fields of cultivation spotted with mulberry trees, the
trunks of which seem vivid purple in the afternoon light.</p>

<p>I make a remark in Spanish. (Jan was still at the stage
of appreciative listener).</p>

<p><i>The Clerkly Man</i>: "Señora, your Spanish is good for a
stranger&mdash;you can pronounce the Spanish J, which is difficult
for foreigners."</p>

<p><i>I</i>: "I have learned that from speaking German; it is
rather like the German <i>ch</i>."</p>

<p>A discussion on idioms at once begins. The Spaniard,
though he speaks foreign languages badly, has an inextinguishable
interest in the subject of tongues. If ever you are bored
in Spanish company start an argument about languages.
After the discussion has been going on for some while the
pale Señor says:</p>

<p>"Nevertheless it is sad that the Catalans wish to root
Castilian out of their country."</p>

<p><i>Luis</i> (with some heat): "Well! why should they not?
They are the hardest working and the most valuable people
of Spain. Why should not they do as they like? Why
should everybody not do as he likes if he hurts nobody
else?"</p>

<p><i>The pale Señor</i> (with frigidity): "But that is Bolshevism."</p>

<p><i>Luis</i> (with increasing heat): "If that is Bolshevism then
I do not mind being a Bolshevik."</p>

<p>Conversation is at an impasse. The carriage flings us to
and fro for a while.</p>

<p>A motor-car passes us. The dust which is about six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
inches deep on the road is whirled up in a cloud so thick that
we have to halt for a few minutes to allow it to settle, or we
might have driven into the deep water-channels which edge
each side of the road.</p>

<p><i>Luis</i> (to the Clerkly Man): "My friends want to live for
a while out in the mountains. Do you by any chance know
of a house?"</p>

<p><i>The Clerkly Man</i>: "I am living with my family in the
monastery of Fuen Santa. There is a guest house there and
habitations are to let. I will find out all about them if you
wish."</p>

<p><i>The pale little Señor</i> (who has apparently forgotten all about
Bolshevism): There are one or two houses in my village of
Verdolay. The proprietor is a friend of mine. I will inquire
for you about it."</p>

<p>The tartana stops.</p>

<p>In front of a solitary house is a small wooden frame on
which a few strips of dusty meat are hung. The driver buys
some of this from the woman who comes out of the house.</p>

<p><i>The Driver</i> (confidentially to the passengers): "Better get
a bit of meat while you have the chance."</p>

<p>Nobody follows his example. The carriage bumps on.</p>

<p>The sun is now shining through the thin dust-laden trees
which edge the road: they appear as flames of pale gold.</p>

<p>We mount over a bridge. A broad deep but waterless
canal stretches away to right and left.</p>

<p><i>The little Señor</i>: "We are now nearing Verdolay. It is
still too hot for you to go hunting for a house. I shall be
delighted if you will take possession of my house until the
sun is cooler."</p>

<p><i>Luis</i>: "Señor, I thank you very much, but we cannot
do it."</p>

<p><i>The little Señor</i>: "I insist&mdash;you will come?"</p>

<p><i>Luis</i>: "Thank you very much."</p>

<p>This is Spanish courtesy. A single invitation is for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
politeness only, like the last piece of bread and butter left
for Miss Manners. A second invitation means that it is really
offered.</p>

<p>We pass a group of houses the colour of baked bread;
the most arid-looking spot we have seen as yet. The gardens
come to an abrupt end. The road rises slightly, and grey-green
olive foliage over gnarled trunks throw a thin lacework
of shadow on the dry earth.</p>

<p>The tartana stops.</p>

<p>We all get out.</p>

<p>The clerkly man goes east; the priest south; we, led by
the pale Señor, west.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We were at the entrance of a village. It spread over a
mound at the foot of the higher hills. It was like a pyramid
with toy houses coloured yellow, orange, green and grey upon
the ledges, and all around trees like those from a child's play
box. The village was fronted by a line of houses painted a
deep crimson-vermilion. An iron windmill for pumping water
was placed on the extreme point of the mound.</p>

<p>The little Señor showed us through the village to his
house and left us in the entrada, while he went to get beer.
The room was decorated with wooden "art-nouveau" chairs,
oleographs and an extremely bad oil painting of a bull with
banderillas shedding much blood. On a cane table was a
gramophone.</p>

<p>The little Señor had shut a door made on the system of a
Venetian blind to keep out the sun, and presently the lattice-work
was crowded with children trying to peer in at us.</p>

<p>The Señor returned preceded by a large English setter.
He drew the corks of the beer and asked us to make ourselves
at home.</p>

<p>"The house and all that is in it is at your service," he
said in the phrase of Spanish courtesy.</p>

<p>I was patting the dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"That dog," said the little Señor, "is a very valuable
dog. It is unique in the province and possibly is unique
in the south of Spain. It has a romantic history. It is bred
by the monks in high Switzerland, and when the snow is deep
on the mountains it goes out to hunt for lost travellers. It
is the only specimen of a San Bernar' in the south of Spain."</p>

<p>We looked at the setter; and drank some more beer.</p>

<p>"That bull," went on the Señor, pointing to the picture,
"was painted by one of the best bull painters in Spain."</p>

<p>We looked at the picture and again took refuge in beer.
Luis, who did not know about setters, but did know about
pictures, drank in sympathy.</p>

<p>The Señor wound up his gramophone.</p>

<p>"Do you know 'Frou-Frou'?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"'Frou-Frou'?" we said.</p>

<p>"Yes, the French Comic Opera."</p>

<p>"But," said Luis, "have you not by chance a disc of
Spanish music? You see," he added as excuse, "the Señors
are foreign. It interests them to hear the national music,
the Flamenco."</p>

<p>The little Señor pursed his lips.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "it is so vulgar. Nobody wants to hear
that."</p>

<p>He possessed, however, a disc or two which he turned on,
to our delight. But before we left him he insisted that we
should sit through his favourite "Frou-Frou."</p>

<p>We went away. The strains of "Frou-Frou" which the
little Señor had turned on once more followed us on the still
air. The setter-St. Bernard walked with us to the beginning
of the hill, from whence he turned sedately homewards.</p>

<p>We strode upwards&mdash;past cottages of all colours, past a
large rambling monastery, which, perched on the far side of the
Verdolay hill, very cubic in shape, is as romantic as it is possible
for a building to be; past a watercourse, above which were
dwellings hollowed out of the soft rock of the mountain-side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
cave dwellings, and out on to the side of the mountains lying
between Murcia and Carthagena. From here we could appreciate
the width, flatness and verdure of the Murcian valley
in the midst of which was the town, the campanile of the
cathedral soaring into the air.</p>

<p>Here we had our first experience of a Spanish country
walk. We were all wearing alpagatas, the canvas sides of
which are not exceedingly thick. The dried herbage of the
hills was intermingled with all manner of prickly weeds. The
vegetation protects itself in this way from being eaten by
anything less leather-tongued than a goat. The results are
uncomfortable for the walker. The little hairlike spines pierce
the shoes and break off, remaining as a continual irritant until
the shoe is removed. Even then the spines, almost microscopic
in size and almost flesh colour, are often difficult to
find. The same uncomfortable fate is in wait for the unwary
stranger who sits down without having carefully explored the
place where he is going to seat himself. Indeed the fate is
worse, because the thorns thus encountered cannot with
decency be extracted in a public place and the victim is
condemned to a lot similar to that of the naughty schoolboy.</p>

<p>The sun poured the full of its summer power on to the
hill-side, which reflected both heat and light with overpowering
intensity. Though it was almost four o'clock in the afternoon
we felt that our salamandrine limits were being put to
a test. A broad white road, mounting up the hill, crossed
our path and we turned into it.</p>

<p>"We are going to the monastery of La Luz," said Luis.
"I have heard that they sometimes take visitors for short
periods. It would be interesting for you to spend a fortnight
in a monastery."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i116.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The road climbed up beneath high black cliffs. The other
side of the valley was coloured orange and red upon which
the sun was shining with all its force. The side of the hill
was dotted with aloes, some having upright flower stems fifteen
feet high in the air, around the flowers of which the bees
were swarming in harmonious halos. A stately stone pine
overshadowed a medley of old buildings which sprang from
the top of a precipice out of which sprouted the weird branches
of the prickly pear cactus. The road circled round the foot
of this cliff, and still mounted till, making a full semicircle,
it brought us on to a platform. On one side of the flat space
was an open cistern into which led a pipe. From the pipe a
deliberate trickle of water fell. Two women and two men
sat about this pipe slowly filling their amphoras of Grecian
form, while donkeys waited patiently in the background
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
bearing panniers for the water-vessels on their backs. On
the other side of the platform the monastery showed a high
wall with a large gate leading into a courtyard from which
arose the face of the church, painted a Cambridge blue.</p>

<p>We could find no bell. The water-carriers shouted instructions
to us. The bell clanged with an empty sound, as though
echoing through miles of untenanted corridors. We rang
again. No response. We rang three or four times before
we heard the sound of shuffling steps. A peep-hole, shaped
like a cross, opened and an eye examined us. The door swung
slowly open, revealing a small obsequious man dressed in
peasant costume. Through passages we came into a cloister
which was built around a small courtyard full of flowers. In
the middle of the courtyard was a high statue of the Virgin.
It was framed and almost hidden by a creeper which offered
to it a tribute of gorgeous purple bell-shaped flowers. At
the foot of the figure was stretched a large cat. A strange
thought came to me that the cat did not bother itself about
the Virgin other than as something which threw a grateful
shadow.</p>

<p>The apologetic little peasant monk, who had let us in
was evidently an underling. He murmured something about
Brother Juan and went away.</p>

<p>Brother Juan came groaning along the corridor with
rheumatic steps. He had a tiny head and large-framed body;
dressed in peasant's clothes, white shirt, black cummerbund,
short knee trousers, long white drawers to the ankle and
sandals on bare feet. He was rather like a dear old gardener
who has been in the family for years, and who has supported
the teasings of generations of children. Age and a sweet
nature had carved his face with horizontal wrinkles of kindliness;
rheumatism and pain had crossed these with downward
seams of depression.</p>

<p>Luis introduced the object of our visit. Brother Juan
doubtingly shook his head. They did have visitors, yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
but those were always well-known to the monastery. Introductions
would be necessary. But, in any circumstance, the
Father Superior was in Murcia at the moment, and nothing
could be done without him.</p>

<p>I, made conceited by the praise of the clerkly man in the
carriage, then tried to charm Brother Juan by a series of
apposite remarks in my most careful Spanish.</p>

<p>Brother Juan scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, what the Señora says is very interesting."
He raised his hands and eyes in pantomimed dismay. "But,
oh, these languages! I can't understand a word!"</p>

<p>Brother Juan, groaning with rheumatism, led us to the
gate. By some means an old woman dressed in black had
joined us. As Juan was taking his leave of us his eyes
suddenly lit up with a merry twinkle.</p>

<p>"If you will excuse me," he said to Luis, "it would be
better, when you see the Father Superior, if the woman would
dress rather less indecently. You see, we are monks and
are not used to it."</p>

<p>We went down the hill accompanied by the old woman
in black, who was chuckling at Brother Juan's last remark.</p>

<p>"If only the woman would ... he ... he ... we are
monks and aren't used to it ... ho ... ho."</p>

<p>I was surprised. It had not seemed to me that I was
indecent. I was wearing an ordinary English midsummer
walking dress. Luis said:</p>

<p>"I think it was the opening at your neck that worried
him. You see we haven't really taken up the open neck in
Murcia as yet."</p>

<p>Directed by the old woman, we scrambled down steep
paths to the bottom of the orange-coloured ravine, and up the
other side past the aloes; we went through an olive grove, and
again up a steep zigzag road to the second monastery. Here
lived the clerkly man, but we did not know his name. This
monastery began with a terra-cotta-coloured Gothic church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
with three tall towers and a cupola of blue glazed tiles, and
rambled on up the ridge of a long hill to end in a tall building
which looked like an overgrown Turkish bath. A grey
building with a huge entrance door was pointed out as the
<i>pension</i> of the monastery. We wandered into a large courtyard
and to us came a fat priest wearing a biretta. He was
courteous but firm.</p>

<p>"We have no room," he said.</p>

<p>But we remembered that the clerkly one had said that
there was room. I suppose again my dress was the real
objection.</p>

<p>We went back towards the village of the little Señor.
On our way we again crossed the dusty road which led to
La Luz. A carriage was driving along it. In the carriage
were two priests. Luis said:</p>

<p>"There probably goes the Father Superior. Shall we ask
him now?"</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation we turned and strode up the
hill. We had to walk fast to catch the carriage, but at last
the driver, perceiving that we were following him, halted.</p>

<p>"No," said one of the priests, "we are not the Superior
of La Luz. Indeed, at this moment he is behind you.
There."</p>

<p>He pointed out an old man in the costume of a peasant,
who, bent with age, was toiling up the hill aided by his staff.
The Father Superior was still some distance away. Hastily,
with a brooch, we pinned my blouse up close around my
throat.</p>

<p>The Father Superior had the face of one designed to be
an ascetic, but his expression was inscrutable. He was very
suave. He felt honoured, he said, by the request of the
Señors, but there was no room. Now Brother Juan had said
that there was room.</p>

<p>Luis tried to urge the matter: he instanced our Red Cross
work in Serbia. The Father Superior said it was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
praiseworthy of us, but ... and bowing unfelt regrets he
left us.</p>

<p>We went back to our little Señor.</p>

<p>He found for us a woman with the usual pound's weight of
keys and conducted us to two bright red houses. Both were
one story in height, but one was for three months' tenancy
only. We decided to take the other. It was occupied to
its limits by a Spanish family, so we took but the most
cursory of glances into it. Then, our business settled, we said
au revoir to the little Señor, who in Spanish fashion offered
us his services whenever they should be needed.</p>

<p>We walked down a road and, in a short while, came to
the village of Alverca. This was the first typical Spanish
village we had passed through. It was long, stretched on the
edge between the bare mountain and the fertile valley. The
houses were low, one-storied for the most part, and the dust
was all-prevalent. In the dusty street boys were playing
football, which in Spain seems to be a summer game. In
the middle of the village was a shop, which advertised itself
as a Tobacco Agency, for tobacco is a Spanish government
monopoly and can be sold only in licensed places. We went
in to get a drink and to ask if by chance they had some tobacco,
for all the while we were in Spain there was a famine of
tobacco.</p>

<p>The inside of the shop was a curious mixture of the modern
and of the very ancient. At one end of the counter was a
modern brass beer machine, with carbonic acid gas cylinder&mdash;which
gives to the tepid beer an extra fizz&mdash;pressure gauge
and lead-lined sink. At the other end of the shop were huge
jars four feet high, and nine or ten feet in circumference;
amphoras of pale porous unglazed pottery, direct successors
of the Grecian vase; small drinking pots of clay with short
spouts for water or of glass with long spouts for wine, the latter
in shape not unlike the brass drinking-vessels of Benares.
Pendent from the ceiling hung candles two or three feet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
length, for devotional purposes, and side by side with the
candles were festooned strings of orange-coloured, highly
flavoured sausages, which appeared very ominous. Some
day one felt that one would be tempted by a Spanish friend to
eat one of these sausages, and the fear of the experiment
was always within us. Wine of a deep ruby tinged with
brown filled a large glass barrel; wine which could be bought
for one halfpenny a glass.</p>

<p>Inside the shop, leaning against the zinc bar, were two
tramps; the one swart with three days' beard on his chin,
dressed in a blue jean smock and soiled yellow velveteen
trousers; the other leaner, more pallid, furtive: in spite of
the heat of the day he was covered with a large black cloak.</p>

<p>They at once offered us their glasses of wine.</p>

<p>"Gracias. Buen aproveche," said we in customary refusal.
They offered cigarettes to Jan and Luis. These, by
courtesy, had to be accepted.</p>

<p>While we were drinking our tepid beer&mdash;fizzed up with
the carbonic acid gas&mdash;Jan asked for and bought a box of
matches. The Spanish matches, very bad, a government
monopoly, are packed in a small cardboard box. This box is
quite difficult to open. Whichever way you push it, like the
well-known trick matchbox, the inside part seems to have
two bottoms and no opening. The impatient traveller
usually tears the box to pieces trying to get at the forty
matches which are inside.</p>

<p>Jan asked for tobacco.</p>

<p>"There is not," sighed the fat woman.</p>

<p>Outside the shop the two tramps were waiting for us. The
swart one peered quickly from left to right.</p>

<p>"We have tobacco," he said in a hoarse whisper. He
snapped his fingers at his companion, who produced from
beneath the cloak, furtively, a square orange packet.</p>

<p>"Good tobacco from Gibraltar," growled "Swart"; "will
you buy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Luis.</p>

<p>The pallid man slid the tobacco beneath the cloak again.
The two slouched off through the dust.</p>

<p>"That would be tobacco at each end and cabbage or other
refuse in the middle," said Luis.</p>

<p>We turned towards the setting sun.</p>

<p>Murcia has a tramway system. Blue cars run all over the
town and reach out into the country at several spots. We
came to the terminus in this direction at Palma, on the road
to Carthagena. The people of the village crowded about us
in curiosity; but by this time we were becoming used to a
publicity which is, as a rule, only reserved for Royalty.</p>

<p>As the tram carried us home&mdash;with several halts due to
failure of the electrical supply&mdash;we noticed through an open
door a delightful interior, decorated with the huge water-jars&mdash;on
a raised step&mdash;with which beautiful specimens of old Spanish
pottery were arranged.</p>

<p>The village of the little Señor had pleased us so much that
we made arrangements to move out there as soon as possible;
for the heat of Murcia was now unbearable and we were in
consequence on the verge of being really ill</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h4>VERDOLAY&mdash;HOUSEKEEPING</h4>


<p>The house in Verdolay had five large rooms, stone-floored,
and was unfurnished. We decided to borrow all our
friend's kitchen furniture, to wit, a table, three chairs,
water-vessels, etc., and we bought for ourselves a large frying-pan.
But the bed was a problem. Our friend's bed looked
too good to knock about, so at last we determined on the
planks which we had already, and four packing-cases on which
to lay the planks. Antonio, always eager to help us,
promised to find the packing-cases and to make all the arrangements
about a cart. At this moment Antonio's wife Rosa
was ill. He had invited us to a noble lunch, and upon the
day following he had told us that the lunch had disagreed
seriously with Rosa. She did not get better. "There is
much fever with it," said Antonio. Marciana, our charwoman,
of whom we will tell more later, was also working for Antonio,
and would bring us news of Rosa's illness, which appeared
quite serious for so slight a cause.</p>

<p>"We must look out for tummy-troubles," said I.</p>

<p>It is amazing what a lot a small amount of furniture
appears when one is preparing to move. We had thought
the cart much too big, but we had some difficulty in stacking
into it all our material, including the guitar, of which the
driver was told to take especial care.</p>

<p>We drove out to Verdolay in a tartana, passing on the
road our cart of furniture. We noted that the driver had added
above our load two huge bundles of straw colour. We wondered
what they might be. We were to discover later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>The little Señor took us to the owner of our prospective
abode. His house was full of children, and the study, where
we signed a Spanish agreement, was festooned with swords,
pistols and guns, while a large photograph of him in officer's
uniform explained the meaning of this warlike equipment.
The proprietor, Don Ferdinand&mdash;a most unmilitary
looking man&mdash;received our money with aloof dignity; but
said, after the transaction was over, that if we ever needed
a friend we now knew where to look for him. Subsequently
Don Ferdinand placed in the yard next to ours a large dog,
which howled all night and prevented us from sleeping,
but the friendliness which he had professed did not induce
him to move it.</p>

<p>The cart of furniture had not arrived by the time we
were in full possession of our new home. The front door
led into a large entrada, from which one passed into an equally
spacious kitchen, and then by a wide double door into the
back yard. To the right and left of the entrada were rooms
with windows, covered with a grille, looking on to the road.
To the right of the kitchen the last room had a window
looking into the yard.</p>

<p>Evening had come and still the cart delayed. Antonio had
given us an introduction to a friend called "La Merchora."
We found her in the village shop which she owned. Her shop
was smaller than that in Alverca, but similar, save that she
sold her beer in bottles and dispensed with the beer machine.
The same bilious-looking sausage hung in festoons from the
ceiling. She was like a fat, happy aunt to us, talked very
fast, but was very proud of being able to understand what I
said. She assured us that she would arrange things for us.</p>

<p>In the dusk we sat on the step of our empty house, and,
illuminated by the light of a couple of candles lent by the
little Señor, we ate provisions which we providentially had
brought with us in the tartana. The cart arrived at about
eight o'clock. The two large bundles had disappeared, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
a certain amount of chopped straw scattered about amongst
the furniture showed us what they had contained. The driver
hesitated before accepting the tip which Jan offered him.</p>

<p>We set up the bed as best we could. We had intended
to put the packing-cases upright, but the structure seemed
rather unsafe; so we laid them flat, put two of the planks
lengthways and the rest crossing. Unfortunately two of the
packing-cases were much narrower than the others. This
made the structure slope down about a foot at one end.
We did not have time or surplus energy to alter this arrangement
during our stay, with the result that in the morning
we had as a rule slipped gently down so that our feet projected
some distance beyond the end of the bed. Mosquitoes had
threatened us during our meal, so that we rigged the net at
once.</p>

<p>We had been warned by many travellers of the verminous
condition of Spain. We had taken the chances of this house,
which in truth had appeared reasonably clean. Nevertheless
we went to bed with some anxiety. No sooner had we
lain down and the candle was out, than the trouble began.
It was as though we had been invaded by a hundred thousand
bugs. We both tossed about and cursed our luck. Suddenly
a piercing and prolonged sting made me clap my hand suddenly
to the spot attacked. I had imprisoned something. I had
experienced bugs in Serbia: this did not seem like a bug,
but much larger.</p>

<p>"Jan," I exclaimed, "I've caught something. Strike a
light." The match revealed <i>a short piece of chopped straw</i>.
The carter, with his bundles of chaff, had provided us with
as uncomfortable a specimen of an "apple-pie" bed as it has
been my lot to experience. The chaff had sifted down through
everything, and had impregnated both the cover of the
mattress and the sheets with the fine spikes of straw. We
spent the better part of the night picking the tiny irritants
out of our bedding. Even the thought that the house had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
proved bugless was at that moment but a poor solace. In
addition to our discomforts of that night, the house was
almost unbearable from the heat. We had chosen our first
residence with some lack of experience. The house, we discovered
on the morrow, faced east and west, and not, as did
the majority of the houses in the village, north and south.
In consequence of this fact we suffered from the sun, which
poured through the front door all the morning, and through
the back door all the afternoon. It was almost impossible
to open the windows on both sides, to allow a draught to pass
through the house. And for the worst house in the village
we were being charged forty pesetas a month by our <i>friend</i>,
Don Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The discomforts of the night were added to by the cats,
which chose our back wall for the most awesome serenades
we have ever heard; and also by the plaintive baaing of a
sheep tethered in an adjoining yard. We fell into an uneasy
sleep about dawn, but were soon awakened by strange sounds
which came from the kitchen. We listened, but could
make nothing of them; they were strange hollow vocal
sounds as though a small carpet was being beaten at irregular
intervals. The front door was locked, the front windows
barred; what had come in must have done so by the back,
over the wall. What was it? Jan peeped through a crack
of the door. On the kitchen floor was a flock of pigeons, which
had come in to search the chaff, scattered by the previous
night's unpacking, for grains of corn.</p>

<p>It was now about 5.30. We decided to rest for a while,
in view of the failure of our sleep. A rousing thump, thump
on the front door drew Jan once more from bed.</p>

<p>At the door was a brown-faced peasant, clad in black
cotton, with bare sandalled feet. Spotted about the street were
goats, their distended udders almost trailing on the ground.</p>

<p>"Milk," said the peasant. "Do you want milk? La
Merchora sent me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i127.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>He took our milk-jug, selected a goat the udder of which
seemed stretched almost to bursting, and milked the animal
directly into the jug. He handed the jug of milk, hot and
frothy, with a flourish.</p>

<p>"Three fat dogs and a little bitch," said he.</p>

<p>In such a hot country the milk keeps better inside the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
animal than outside. Milk shops in Spain therefore are
usually quadruped, and there is never a question of inspector
or of adulteration.</p>

<p>We made up our minds to get up. We did not know
what other venders La Merchora had prepared for us.</p>

<p>We had scarcely finished our breakfast of tea, bread and
chocolate, when another thump, thump on the door announced
the arrival of another ascetically faced peasant, tall, clad
in blue. With him was a pretty girl of about fifteen and a
dusty, tilted donkey-cart.</p>

<p>"Vegetables and fruit," said the girl.</p>

<p>The man, having firmly fixed in his head that we knew
no Spanish, grunted and made noises, strange though cheery,
in his throat. The inside of the cart was piled with all
manner of excellent things&mdash;tomatoes, green and yellow
melons, berenginas, peaches, plums, pears, red peppers,
cucumbers, potatoes, huge purple onions, and lemons.</p>

<p>We bought many things. The system of weights and
measures is supposed to be that of the kilogramme, as it is
in France, but the methods by which these weights are translated
into practice in Spain is delightful. Evidently there
is no inspection of weights and measures. One of the
weights used by the tall man was a small axe-head, another
was a lump of rock.</p>

<p>After the donkey-cart, a man stumpy enough to be almost
a dwarf rode up to our steps. He was grim-visaged and
paunchy; and said in a sour voice that he would fetch us
water if we so wished. The price was one peseta a donkey-load,
a donkey-load of water being four full Grecian vases
(called cantaros) which were carried in panniers, on the top
of which the old man sat and looked grumpily at the world,
while the water gurgled and clucked cheerfully beneath him.</p>

<p>Then came a witch-faced woman with a disagreeable voice.
She carried a huge basket and said she was the shopping
woman of Verdolay. Verdolay had no market, nor could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
one buy there anything other than the few immediate necessities
which La Merchora sold. This woman was equivalent
to our country carriers. She walked to Murcia every day
and returned with laden basket through the heated dust.
For this work she demanded a small percentage upon the
value of her purchases; probably she also extracted a small
commission from the shops in which she dealt. We did not
employ her much, as her temperament was not agreeable to us.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i129.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Last of all came a little old woman&mdash;with a face seamed
like a kindly walnut&mdash;dragging an old grey donkey. On the
donkey's back was a pair of time-worn panniers from which
bulged a medley of fruit and vegetables. She was the donkey-cart's
rival. I had forgotten to buy onions.</p>

<p>During our trip we had been bothered by the fact that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
at moments our uncertain Spanish would be displaced by the
language we had last learned, Serbian. Instead of the Spanish
sentence, quite against our wills Serbian would speak itself.
This phenomenon is quite common, I believe, to those who
learn several languages more or less imperfectly.</p>

<p>I now asked the old woman in unwished-for Serbian for
onions. She struck an attitude of theatrical dismay.</p>

<p>"Señora," she exclaimed, "que es eso?"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I repeated my desire, and again Serbian came out. The
old lady shook her head, and seemed frightened. I got a
strong hold over my tongue, and said slowly in Spanish:</p>

<p>"Tiene cebollas?"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The old lady's face broke into a hundred wrinkles of
delight.</p>

<p>"Ahe, Señora," she cried, "if you say 'cebollas,' I can
understand that you want cebollas. But if you say something
different from 'cebollas,' how can I know that you need
cebollas?"</p>

<p>We walked round the corner to La Merchora's to discover
what could, and what could not, be bought at first hand.
La Merchora could supply us with olive oil, but not with
vinegar. She sold beer, wine, lemonade and soda-water in
siphons; dried sardines, very smelly; orange-coloured sausages;
bread at a peseta the kilo; Dutch cheese, red pepper, chocolate
and eggs. The last-named item on the list she said was scarce
and variable in quality. I then asked her if it would be
possible to find a maid in the village. The little Señor had
said that servants were as plentiful as flies in June, but La
Merchora said that they were as scarce as were the eggs.
All the girls went off to Murcia, she said. There were several
women in the little shop and a discussion began; they reviewed
a list of the likely girls. A young woman came in, and said at
once that her sister was out of a job. She would send her
along. La Merchora was reluctant to tell us the correct price</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>to pay. I suppose she thought that she might be spoiling
a beautiful piece of bargaining. Upon pressure, however,
she admitted that the local price was about ten pesetas a
month, this to include all the washing of linen, both house
and personal.</p>

<p>We bought some of La Merchora's chocolate. She asked
us if we would have Spanish or French flavouring. We
naturally chose the Spanish variety. It was very cheap. It
had a dusty consistency in the mouth, and tasted of chocolate
not at all, but strongly of cinnamon. It was eatable, but
not exciting; we consoled ourselves with the reflection that
it was nourishing without temptations towards greediness
and ate no other chocolate during our stay in Verdolay.
Behind her shop La Merchora had a large yard, with outside
stove for cooking. In the yard was a flock of turkeys and
several pigs. A black and white terrier pup was having a
game with the pigs, running about and pulling their tails
with his sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Our house had inconveniences. There was, as far as we
could see, no place to put household refuse, nor any means in
the village of collecting it. The windows on the road commanded
a view almost of the whole house, and if we left them
open at once the curious were at the grilles, staring through
at us. As we could not open the back door or windows
during the afternoon, this meant that if we wished for privacy
we had to live in semi-gloom. Nobody in Spain, however,
tries to live other than in public; the people walked in and
watched us as we were having our meals; walked round the
house examining with interest the pictures which we hung
on the walls to dry; and in time we became case-hardened to
this semi-public life.</p>

<p>We had a siesta during the afternoon to make up for the
sleep we had lost. At first we lay down without the mosquito-net,
but the flies soon drove us to its protection. In the evening
we called on the little Señor. He was a delicate and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
likeable man, but his pretty wife showed a strong dislike for
us, for which we could find no explanation save that perhaps
she had been a pro-German during the war. We sat uncomfortably
in a mixed atmosphere of liking and hate for some
while, then, making our adieux, and followed by the setter-St.
Bernard, we went home.</p>

<p>I think that we first discovered the lack of privacy while
we were undressing. We had left the front windows open for
air, and soon a crowd was watching our preliminaries to sleep.
Luckily we discovered it early. Jan closed the shutters, upon
which a number of boys sat down on our doorstep and sang
serenades to us for several hours</p>

<h4>VERDOLAY&mdash;SKETCHING IN SPAIN</h4>


<p>Sketching in Spain has inconveniences. In the summer
the heat makes it imperative that the painter should be
up with the dawn, for between eleven a.m. and four p.m.
the heat and the brilliance of the light impose too great a
strain on the eyes and the endurance. Under any circumstances
we were almost forced to rise with the sun, for
Milk and Vegetables both called before six.</p>

<p>Verdolay was an excellent spot at which to begin an
acquaintance with Spanish scenery. There was a great variety
of subject matter. The village itself was full of vividly coloured
houses, and at the back was the wonderful old monastery of
Santa Catalina. In the valley less than half a mile away were
the huertas, or irrigated gardens, full of rich green. On the
sides of the mountains were the olive terraces, which traced
the architecture of the hills in a way to delight the painter's
heart. Between the olives and the garden was the dusty
cart road with its intermittent traffic, and the small dusty
strung-out villages, the houses threaded on the road like
beads on a necklace, especially that one called El Angel&mdash;though
anything more arid and less angelic could hardly be
imagined. In the hills themselves were fine ravines of
strangely coloured ferruginous earths, orange, purple and
blue; and the tops of the foothills were often crested with
monasteries, like that of La Luz, which gave the scene a
most romantic atmosphere. I clung more or less to the
village, Jan wandered about the surrounding country or sat
in the insufficient shadow of the olive trees near El Angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i134.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The first real inconvenience which we noted was that seldom
did the best view possess a suitable piece of shade from which
to paint it. Thus the artist's task was doubled; one had to
find coincident scene and shadow. The apparently aimless
wander of the artist looking for a subject usually excited the
curiosity of the passers-by, so that either one was irritated
by a series of remarks or became possessed of a small following
of the curious. I use a square hole cut in a piece of cardboard
in order to test the view and judge whether it would frame
as satisfactorily as it promised to do. Whenever I placed
this square to my eye one of my followers bobbed up his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
head and stared back at me through the hole, trying to
fathom the mystery of my act. Once I had begun work I
would become the centre of an excited conversation.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i135.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>

</div>

<p>The first strokes of the brush aroused merriment. But
often some onlooker astonished me by perceiving the object
of my sketch long before the drawing was in any way clear.
She (it was generally a she) would then be eager to exhibit
her superior knowledge to the others. She would therefore
dab her finger on to my painting to point out what she had
perceived. This nuisance I fought by covering intrusive fingers
with oil paint. By the time the overwise one had cleaned
off the paint the drawing would be far advanced enough
for the others to see for themselves what I was doing. As soon
as I got well into the swing of work questions would begin.</p>

<p>"Why do you do this? Is it to make picture postcards
from? Why isn't your husband with you? Are your father
and mother alive? Do you like Spanish food? Have you
got any children? If you have no children, as we have too
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
many, would you like a baby to take away with you? Are
you doing this for the cinematograph? Do you like painting?
How old are you? Why haven't you put in So-and-so's
house?" In this case the house in question was usually
behind me.</p>

<p>These questions were asked in Murcian Spanish not very
easy to understand with my small lack of acquaintance;
and I had to take my attention off my painting in order to
find suitable Spanish answers. I tried once not to answer,
but my audience then demanded:</p>

<p>"Are you deaf? Can't you hear? Don't you understand
what we say?"</p>

<p>All this was said with the most courteous of intentions,
direct questioning being permissible in Spain. Chairs were
generally brought out, one for me and others for the spectators.
Nurse-maids with half-nude babies formed a large
proportion of my audiences. The Spanish baby suffers from
over nursing; it is carried remorselessly about from six in the
morning till twelve at night; it is as a rule fretful and feverish
both from the heat and from lack of sleep. Indeed Verdolay
always shrilled with wailing children.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock the Spaniard takes a morning snack.
This consists of a slice of bread soaked with olive oil and a
dried sardine, the smell of which was almost paralysing. With
the perfect courtesy which marked all my peasant audiences,
this would be offered to me before it was chewed loudly in
my ear. When the heat was very great I would abandon my
sketch as soon as the sardine stage arrived.</p>

<p>I was continually pestered by polite requests that So-and-so
should be painted in. This often led to a lecture on composition
and on the introduction of figures. If I did, however,
paint in anybody the enthusiasm was enormous. People would
run down the road shouting in at every cottage door:</p>

<p>"She has painted Enrico" (or Miguel or Maria) "into
her picture."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>Once while near the water-fountain I painted in the
donkey of a water-carrier. For days afterwards Paco, the
donkey-boy, grasped the passers-by and exclaimed with tears
of joy in his voice:</p>

<p>"Ha pintado mi burro, <i>mi</i> burro."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The water-fountain was one of the gathering places of
the village. It was the end of a small iron pipe which writhed
down from the hills.</p>

<p>There were generally three or four donkey-boys with
cantaros, and a crowd of women with amphoras waiting their
turns to wedge their pots beneath the small trickle which ran
from the nozzle of the pipe. Old Grumpy spent the best
part of his day there, sitting with sour face in the shadow of
a small tree&mdash;his chief work was either waiting his turn or
leaving his pots to fill themselves. A tall bank of prickly
pear cactus made a background to the gay scene. Women
came from dawn until midnight, and even from the villages
of the valley, for water was very scarce and most of the
water in the valley wells unfit for drinking. With their
heavy cantaros balanced on a projecting hip, these women
walked two miles or more beneath the sweltering sun; and
they asked me if I <i>liked</i> painting.</p>

<p>Sometimes the ladies of the village stopped and made
suitable remarks. One, a summer visitor, told me that she
knew a very good painter&mdash;"very good indeed," she said
with a gentle emphasis which revealed what she thought of
my work. "Why, he painted things five times as big as
these which you do."</p>

<p>As the sketch progressed my audiences were very eager
to point out to me anything which I seemed to have forgotten.
At this moment somebody always said that Uncle
Pepe's or Aunt Conchas' house wasn't in the sketch. These
houses were invariably out of sight or behind my back.
The Spaniards had futuristic instincts. But once they knew</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>
<p>me, my friends would not have me criticized. One passer-by
made some disparaging remark about the painting.</p>

</div>

<p>"We won't have our Doña abused," said the nurse-maids.
"She is very clever. She knows lots more than you do;
and plays the piano as well."</p>

<p>Sometimes I accompanied Jan out into the country, in
the direction of La Luz or down into the huertas.</p>

<p>One day we were near La Luz and my interest was captured
by a lemon and vine garden which was cultivated on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
terraces down the side of a baking ravine. The farmer's
house with a red roof topped the hill. I sat down to paint.
Presently the farmer with his wife and family clambered down
into the ravine and climbed up the side to where I was sitting.
Each time I returned the family came back and in awed silence
watched the progress of the sketch.</p>

<p>It happened that the water of Verdolay was not very
nice for drinking purposes, being full of minerals and salts,
while that of La Luz was delicious. A poor woman, who did
charing jobs for the farmer above-mentioned, was delighted
to be allowed to carry us heavy cantaros full of La Luz water,
a mile and a half, for the pay of fivepence a cantaro. One
day after the sketch was finished she came in with a look of
importance on her face.</p>

<p>"My Señora," she said, "is enamoured of the little painting
which you have done of her house and farm. She wishes to
buy the sketch."</p>

<p>I had had some experience of Spanish prices, so I
said:</p>

<p>"These paintings are made to exhibit in England. It is
of no use to tell you the price, because English prices and
Spanish prices are different."</p>

<p>"But, Señora," said the woman, "my masters are very
rich, excessively rich. They will pay any price that you like
to ask."</p>

<p>But I suspected her protestations. The sketch was one
of the best I had done in Spain. I was not very eager to
part with it. But owing to her entreaties, against my better
judgment, fixing a low price because of Spain, I said at
last:</p>

<p>"Two hundred pesetas."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Her mouth dropped open. For a moment she remained
speechless with amazement. Then hastily crossing herself
she gasped out:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>"Madre Maria Sanctissima!"</p>

<p>Being a woman I was often asked to paint female portraits,
but suspecting the monetary value which the people
would put on paintings I refused. Jan overheard a red-faced,
wealthy looking farmer discussing with his father on our
doorstep the question of how much I was likely to ask for a
portrait of the farmer's daughter.</p>

<p><i>Red Face</i>: "I think we might offer her ten pesetas."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><i>The Grandfather</i>: "Well, she is foreign, she might demand
fifteen."</p>

<p><i>Red Face</i>: "Even if she wishes twenty we might yet
consider it; or perhaps twenty-five; but then we would
have to think it carefully over."</p>

<p>Occasionally we would be asked into houses to examine
pictures which the peasants believed to have value. In one
house, a room was set aside as a small private chapel; it was
full of painted plaster images covered with false jewels and
tinsel; on the walls were oleograph reproductions of the
Virgin by Spanish Old Masters, but one painting of the
Murillo School probably had a real value. In another house
we found a picture of Napoleon before which the inhabitants
were burning a candle under the impression that the print
represented an unidentified Saint. Maybe stranger personalities
have been canonized before now.</p>

<p>Jan escaped from intimate touch with the people by
making for the open country. He thus had fewer adventures
than did I. Often, however, peasants spied him from the
distance of a mile, and came to see what he was doing.</p>

<p>Once, when he had been painting on the cart-road near
El Angel and had put a cart into his painting, a small boy
followed him all the way home, shouting out to every one
that he passed:</p>

<p>"That is a painter! He painted a cart and horse; just
as it went along; all in a flash!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>We used to pin up our sketches on the wall of the house;
because, as we intended to travel, we wished the sketches
to become as dry as we could make them. This used to
attract numbers of people, and usually the grilled window
of our front room was occupied by a crowd of faces peering
into the house. The fame of our picture exhibition spread
over the country-side. People came from some distance to
see the pictures; and if the front door was unlocked walked
in, saluted us, and proceeded to go the round of the walls.
At first we found this disconcerting, but with use much of
our needless self-consciousness and desire for unessential
privacy began to wear off.</p>

<p>As we left our front window open during the night for air,
we were many times awakened by the voices of the picture-gazers
who gathered at our window as soon as the day broke</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h4>VERDOLAY&mdash;CONENI</h4>


<p>The peasant who came every morning with his daughter
and donkey-cart full of vegetables and fruit at the
dawn was rather like a genial bird of prey in features.
This type is typically Spanish. There was something of the
condor about him, though one can scarcely picture a condor
with his welcoming smile or his kindly nature. He began
with a fixed idea of our practical dumbness and deafness to
the Spanish language. He was, we learned later, an exquisite
dancer. We have heard tell of a well-known musician who
has a dance for making the household beds, and another for
digging potatoes, and so on, trying to bring æsthetics into the
commonplaces of life. Coneni, for such was the peasant's
name, tried to dance for us the fact that tomatoes were a
halfpenny a pound or that a melon was sixpence. His pretty,
demure daughter resorted to more practical measures, held
up fruit as samples and condescended to calculate in pesetas
and centimos instead of in "royals" and "little bitches."</p>

<p>But the manners both of Coneni and of his daughter
were impeccable. I think that they overcharged us slightly,
but that was the Spanish tradition. Certainly they did not
overcharge us as much as they would have done had they
not liked us, and later on they quieted their consciences by
making us presents.</p>

<p>Coneni was one of the first of our picture admirers, but
he had pre-Raphaelite tendencies, and always said that he
supposed they would be better when we painted them out
properly. He became eager that we should sketch in his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
market garden, and gave us elaborate topographical directions.
So one day, shouldering our sketch-boxes, off we set.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i143.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>We passed through El Angel on to the Murcia road. We
then asked a group of men, who were winnowing corn on a
flat biblical threshing floor of beaten mud, which was the
direction. Unfortunately we had got rather mixed in the
name. The peasant had not spoken his name very clearly
and we had confused it with conecho.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The winnowers said
that they could not understand us very clearly, but that it
was probably further along, and they wished us to "go with
God." Further along the road we, having found in the
dictionary what conecho really means, tried the other name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of this brought us into a narrow side-path between
rows of mulberry trees and deep watercourses. It took a
sudden turn to the left, and on the path we saw Coneni, tall
and lank, waving welcoming arms at us.</p>

<p>The place was embowered in trees: lemon, fig, pear, plum,
apple, quince and pomegranate flourished luxuriantly in
the irrigated soil. The huertas of the Murcian plain were
not separated, one from another, by hedges, and it was difficult
to know how large was Coneni's garden. In one corner,
beneath the shelter of overhanging fruit-trees, was a hut made
of stiff bamboo-like reeds, the roof daubed with mud against
the rain. From the front of this hut projected a long awning
of reeds, beneath which the Coneni family was awaiting us.
Mrs. Coneni was plump, motherly, and had a genial nature
covering an inflexible will. She also had perfect manners,
was full of courtliness and kindness, and was delighted to see
us. She showed her naïve pleasure by touching me whenever
she was able to do so without rudeness. Our broken Spanish
aroused her sense of wonder. Coneni, for the first time in
his life, made up his mind to understand us. He stopped his
habitual pre-breakfast pantomime and swaggered about, saying:</p>

<p>"But I understand all they say. Yes, I do."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the square small hut and came out
again carrying an enormous green water-melon called locally
a sandia. He tapped it with a knuckle and, from the sound
that it made, decided that it was ripe. He then cut off top
and bottom with a small hatchet and divided it into huge
slices. While we were eating the luscious pink fruit neighbours
began to saunter up. They stood in a circle around us.
Coneni, with the air of a showman, said:</p>

<p>"Now I will show you something. She smokes; it is
true. I have seen her myself."</p>

<p>He made me a cigarette. The men were delighted and
Mrs. Coneni was amazed. Coneni stood behind me with a
lean hand on his hip, as if to say: "Alone I did it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Beneath the reed shelter some of the children were lying
asleep, and the youngest of all, a baby, was sitting by itself
in a corner, stark naked, playing with a large lemon. The
exquisite colour contrast between the transparency of skin
of the sunburnt child and the hard yellow brilliance of the
lemon filled me with a wild desire to paint it. Indeed, one
does not come to appreciate the full beauty of the nude until
one has seen it in a country where it is natural. In Spain
the children, usually half nude, sprawled about in the heat
in the most graceful of relaxed poses, sometimes lying half
asleep across their mothers' laps, and a continual impulse
was driving me to make studies of them. But the task is
almost impossible. The fact of being sketched is too unusual.
The people, naturally unselfconscious, at once become stiff
and formal.</p>

<p>Within Coneni's hut was no furniture other than a four-post
bed which almost filled the floor space. Here slept
Coneni and his wife, and the space beneath the bed was used
as a storehouse for melons. The children, three girls and four
boys, all slept on the ground in the open beneath the shelter.
But Mrs. Coneni explained to me with some care that the
poverty was only apparent; that this was but their summer
residence. For the winter they had a fine house in Alverca.</p>

<p>We did not have any very keen impulse to paint&mdash;it had
become for that afternoon rather too much of a ceremony,
like the old State painter <i>performing</i> before the Court&mdash;but
to save our faces we had to do something, so Jan painted a
portrait of a calf, while I selected a lemon tree. Before I
had half finished, the interior of the tree was swarming with
Coneni's children, hoping that they would be included. By
my side sat Coneni's little girl nursing a bantam, like a doll,
assuring it that mother wouldn't love it if it were not more
quiet.</p>

<p>"And the Señor plays the guitar," exclaimed Coneni.
"He is affectionate to music."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>We discussed Spanish music and dancing. Coneni,
bursting with hospitality, said:</p>

<p>"Come again next Sunday. I will invite the young men
and the girls and we will have a party. There are guitar and
lute players at Alverca. They will all come."</p>

<p>Antonio's brother-in-law, Thomas, had spoken of the gay
times when there is a party in the huertas; we accepted
eagerly.</p>

<p>We went home laden with presents of fruit which Coneni
had pressed upon us. Especially was our greed delighted
with a large basket of figs. We had been asking the Conenis
to bring us some figs for some days, but they had said:</p>

<p>"We can't bring you figs. Nobody sells figs here. We
give them to the pigs."</p>

<p>So that evening we rivalled the pigs</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h4>VERDOLAY&mdash;THE INHABITANTS</h4>


<p>The little village of Verdolay was not a characteristic
Spanish village, it was a watering-place. One came
into it along the dusty road between banks on which
grew the spiky aloe shrubs, behind which spread the spaced
olive groves with trees drawn up into demure lines, amongst the
grey foliage of which could be seen the red painted corrugated
roofs of the French Silk Company. The village scrambled
up a terraced hill. The lower edge was a line of orange-vermilion
one-storied houses faced with a small promenade.
Then the houses scattered. To the right as one faced the hill
were the baths, a collection of bulky, ramshackle buildings
which hid deep, cool courtyards, and from which came the
plash of water and the sound of young voices. The hill-side
was covered with terraced gardens in which were set houses
painted yellow, green, blue or pink. The apex of the hill
was decorated by an iron windwheel for pumping. A ridge
joined the crest of the hill to the mountains, and here perched
the ancient monastery of Santa Catalina; while a mile away
to the right, showing white amongst a green bed of palms
and firs, was the country seat of the Count of El Valle, and
to the left amongst groves of oranges was the villa of an
ex-Prime Minister.</p>

<p>One had almost a specimen of Spain in little in this one
village. The vermilion houses, called the Malecon, sheltered
a transitory population; visitors to the baths, who like ourselves
arrived in carts with furniture, and after a few months
disappeared back to town duties. These were usually of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the superior artisan or small shopkeeping class. The second
row of houses contained persons such as Don Ferdinand,
the little Señor or the people who kept the baths. These
represented the larger tradesmen and in general lived all the
year in Verdolay, travelling to Murcia by tartana or by tram
via Palmar. The two roads which swept up each side of the
hill were edged with small cottages where the real peasantry
lived, and the houses which stood amongst gardens on the
hill terraces, each owning its proper entrance, were the residences
of the merchantry. The Count of El Valle represented
the county aristocracy and the ex-Prime Minister the Court.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i148.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In spite of a somewhat evil local reputation, the peasantry
could be counted as a quiet, hard-working, rather unintelligent,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
good-natured community which leaned vaguely, on the male
side, to liberalism and atheism, but lacking the courage or
determination to make either effective. It cursed the Court
and told dirty stories about the priesthood, but all exasperation
evaporated in words. This peasantry is the foundation
on which the whole of this plutocratical hill of Verdolay rests;
and it labours as severely as any other peasantry, perhaps
even working harder because of the lack of water, which adds
a need to be satisfied before work is over. The average
traveller has the idea that the Spaniard is lazy. We are not
sure that this is a correct estimate of him. We English have
made a god of "Work." But indeed unnecessary work
is mere foolishness. The great blessing to be sought for is
leisure. Human advance comes from the reflections of
leisure rather than from the activities of work. The Spaniard
recognizes leisure as the benefit which it is. He has no false
ideas about work. Adam bit the apple, and we pay his debts,
but why load ourselves with compound interest at many
hundreds per cent.? That is the Spaniard's point of view.
He works when he must work. He rises with the dawn or before
it, say four a.m., he works till eleven o'clock, then in the afternoon
resumes toil from 3.30 till 6.30. The late-rising traveller
who mouches about in his English custom during the hottest
hours of the day sees the Spanish labourer at his siesta,
snoozing by the roadside, or thrumming his guitar to a herd of
sleepy goats. He draws a natural, though incorrect, conclusion.</p>

<p>The Spaniard may be dilatory. He puts off doing to-day
what he can do to-morrow, but it is from an exaggerated
respect for the benefits of leisure. His handicap is that he
has no proper means of filling that leisure, his apparent
laziness comes from lack of education. About eighty per cent.
cannot read, schooling is not enforced, and children begin
work at ten years of age or thereabouts. But do not lay up
the Spaniard's desire for inactivity as a crime; it is a virtue
ill employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Our particular specimen of the Spanish peasant was my
female servant, named Encarnacion. She was thirteen years
old, could neither read nor write, and worked like a small
mule for the not extravagant wage of eleven shillings and sixpence
a month. She only worked half the day, it is true,
but we did not give her food. We indeed overpaid her, for
the regular wage of her kind was about eight shillings and fourpence
a month. She had a small, stumpy child's body,
sprouting into a long neck, at the top of which was a rounded
head. Her forehead was intellectual, her features flattened,
and her hair, done up tight into a small ball, was usually
decorated with a flower or a green leaf.</p>

<p>At first, like all Spanish peasants, she made up her mind
that she could not understand what I said, but gradually
learned that she had to do so, and in general succeeded pretty
well. But it was to her a tremendous intellectual effort.
She would wrinkle her noble-looking brow with the strain,
and was never satisfied until she had translated my orders
into her own patois for clarity. But she would not allow
her fundamental ideas of what was proper to be influenced
by my foreign notions. Sometimes she would interrupt me.</p>

<p>"No, Señora," she would say, "I do not like it done thus.
That is not the custom. It must be done so."</p>

<p>If one insisted upon one's own way, the work was ill done.
So that, as a rule, to save trouble, one allowed her to do as
she wished. Encarnacion worked all the morning, singing
an interminable Spanish song, which struck our ears queerly
and pleasantly at the beginning, but of which in the end we
grew very tired. By eleven o'clock she would have done all
the housework, the shopping and the cooking, and would
leave the stone floors soaked in water, the evaporation of
which did a little to counteract the intense heat. She had a
habit which we did not like of scattering our household refuse
all over the small square yard. It looked dirty and untidy,
but we found out that she knew better than we did. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
vagrant cats soon cleared up any remains of meat, while the
hot sun dried up all the other refuse, which could then be
thrown away conveniently.</p>

<p>Encarnacion was sad that she could neither read nor write,
and was proudly jealous of her younger sister, who, working
in the milk factory, was being taught to spell.</p>

<p>She of course acquired a proprietary right in us. She
upheld the honour of the house, and gave a lesson in manners
to a gipsy girl from the cave dwellings who had once thrown
a stone at me. She also criticized our work. To the almost
daily parties of strangers who walked into our house whenever
the door was left unlocked, she acted as guide to our pictures
drying on the walls, and she would explain to whom each
house in the sketches belonged.</p>

<p>But she never said "Thank you."</p>

<p>There are considerable differences between Spanish customs
and those of ordinary Europe, and these are apt to disconcert
the traveller. Here are a few Spanish ones that we noted
<i>en passant</i>.</p>

<p>You may walk into any house or garden if moved to do
so by curiosity if you, previous to entering, utter the magic
formula: "Se pueda entrar?"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>You may stare as much as you like at anything or anybody,
for staring is in reality a compliment.</p>

<p>Self-consciousness is a silly vanity.</p>

<p>If you feel friendly towards an acquaintance you may call
on him at nine in the morning and you may repeat your call
three or four times during the same day. (What the man does
to get rid of you we have not yet discovered. We have only
been the victims, not the visitors.)</p>

<p>You must refuse everything that is suddenly offered to
you, except cigarettes or sweets offered in the fingers. Do
not accept other things until the third offer. But to refuse
sweets or cigarettes is almost insulting.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>You must offer to give any object to anybody who admires
it (especially objects of jewellery or babies).</p>

<p>You may ask any questions you like, even upon the most
intimate of subjects; and you must expect to be asked similar
questions.</p>

<p>If invited to a meal, you may refuse no dish that is served
to you, even though indigestion is clutching at your vitals,
or repletion stopping your throat.</p>

<p>For a specimen of the small tradesman class of the malecon
we had La Merchora. She kept the village shop, the last
house on the terrace, and was in some way a relative of Antonio.
Her home was planned like ours was, and one of the rooms
beside the entrada had been filled with a counter, some
shelves, and a large tin of paraffin oil; ginger-coloured
sausages were festooned from the roof and the shop was complete.
She was unmarried, and therefore, from a theoretical
point of view, negligible; but it did not disturb her. Indeed,
little did disturb her. She had the figure which grows out of
a combination of good living, no thinking and reasonable
working. In any village you will find an example of her kind.
She is good-natured but respected. Liberties are not taken
with her, and in Cornwall she is called Aunt So-and-so. La
Merchora was not even black-visaged, there was in fact
nothing that one can count for Spanish about her.</p>

<p>She had two epithets&mdash;atrocidad and barbaridad&mdash;but
she said them with so jovial an aspect that atrocity or barbarity
faded into the gentlest of denunciations. When our first
servant, Encarnacion's elder sister, deserted us without
warning for a better job, La Merchora said it was an atrocidad;
when the water-carrier overcharged us she said it was barbaridad.
When the Count El Valle's watchman chased us
off some square miles of unfenced unproductive mountain she
said it was atrocidad; when the weather was hot she said it
was barbaridad.</p>

<p>Every evening after supper there was a gathering outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
La Merchora's shop. La Merchora, Uncle Pepe, her father,
the niece, the gaunt woman from next door, her baby, half
naked but with a flower in its hair, women coming through
the night to fetch water (an interminable task), carters returning
from work and others, would gather on chairs, benches, or
on the stone wall of the malecon; and beneath the faint glow
of the electric light would gently talk of things, while the
niece was catching the foolish cicadas or crickets (attracted
by the light) with which to amuse the baby and with which
to awaken in the child some primary instinct of cruelty to
animals.</p>

<p>Uncle Pepe was La Merchora's father. He was a withered
brown peasant baked by the sun to the colour of a pot.
Wrinkles of careful economy and of good humour were as
indelibly roasted into him as the pattern on a Roman dish.
In recognition of La Merchora's accumulated kindnesses I
painted his portrait on a small panel for her. She pondered
some while on the problem of a suitable recompense, and at
last gave us an antique Sevillian basin decorated with a primitive
painting of a yellow and green cat. It was an old and
valuable piece of earthenware used for washing the linen,
and had probably been employed to wash Uncle Pepe's shifts
and himself as well when he was a baby. These basins, two
feet in diameter, are used as decorative and practical adjuncts
to the huge red earthenware pots in which the villagers of the
Murcian valley store the household water. We protested
against the generosity of this gift, but in vain. One day,
while we were out, she had it carried to our house, and would
on no account receive it back.</p>

<p>Pepe and La Merchora illustrate the rapid evolution of
the modern Spanish gentleman. Antonio is the third stage
in the development. The little Señor is the fourth. Pepe
is an unlettered peasant, knowing nothing but the labour of
the soil but possessing the traditional culture of Spain. By
the time one has reached the little Señor and the people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the Baths, one has arrived at letters but one has lost much of
the culture. Pepe's wisdom is the common sense of centuries
stored up in proverbs; he has one to fit every occasion.
The little Señor's learning is supplied by the newspapers.
The grandparents of all these people, even of the rich merchants
who lived on the apex or Verdolay hill, were peasantry&mdash;Pepes,
as a rule. Then one perceives that with the accumulation
of wealth, the culture gradually diminishes in a like
proportion. The third generation has lost almost all culture
and has nothing but a kind heart and a love of making money.
The Spanish bourgeoisie is inverting the processes which are
going forward in England to-day. It is trying to forget its
old customs&mdash;too late we are trying to revive ours. It has
learned to despise its exquisite folk music, already becoming
forgotten&mdash;we are trying to fudge out a few miserable tunes
from the memories of senile fiddlers.</p>

<p>These people have won to that leisure so sweet to the
heart of man; but they don't know what to do with it. They
sleep and so grow fat. Having become fat they are good-natured
and laugh. The old saw should be inverted. Indeed,
many an old saw is in reality the truth turned inside out.
They were a good-natured kindly people, these bulky
tradesmen, but they were deadly dull. The daughters of
Verdolay banged untuned pianos to the strains of dances
forgotten by Europe, polkas, mazurkas and pas de quatre;
but their own dances&mdash;the malagueñas and baturras&mdash;were
unknown to them. They were pressing in their invitations,
and were angry with us because we preferred La Merchora's
doorstep with its changing audience of passers-by.</p>

<p>Of the Count and the ex-Prime Minister we know but little;
they lie, anyway, beyond the scope of this book. The Count
possessed in this district a country house set in a deep, wooded
valley, in which was a medicinal spring, and a few square
miles of unfenced sterile mountain land from which his
watchman, armed with a gun, was instructed to drive away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
unauthorized pedestrians. He was not popular and was
always at daggers drawn with the village; though from other
sources we have learned that he is personally a charming
and a generous man. At any rate he has left a fine estate to
remain practically unproductive (the two farms and the house
itself are in ruins). This practice seems to be normal in Spain,
and we have heard of many a case where the aristocracy have
deliberately hindered national development. There are
rumours, however, that this estate is being bought for the
government and will be afforested and developed.</p>

<p>The ex-Prime Minister's villa was the most amazing
example of bad taste in architecture that we have ever seen</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h4>VERDOLAY&mdash;THE DANCE AT CONENI'S</h4>


<p>We had been looking forward to the dance which Coneni
had promised us. Spanish music had become with
us a hobby, and the dancing which goes with it had
excited our imagination. Antonio's sister had led us to believe
that wonderful dancing was to be found in the Murcian huertas,
and the vague hints of gay times <i>al campo</i> stirred us up to eager
anticipation.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon at about four o'clock we set off,
Jan carrying the big white guitar in its case. The cicadas
were making their accustomed strident din in the mulberry
trees, men on the roadside shouted to us: "Vaya con dios, y
con la guitarra."</p>

<p>The Conenis were furbished up for the occasion. A few
girls in bright cottons and a few young men in check suits,
English caps and buttoned brilliant boots were awaiting us.
Others came in one by one. Coneni chopped up a huge pink-fleshed
melon for us, and while we were yet revelling in its
cool lusciousness the faint sound of music was heard through
the saw-note of the cicadas. The sound came nearer. Presently
through the trees a band of youths and girls headed by a
girl playing a guitar, and a boy of fourteen playing a Spanish
lute (or laud) were visible.</p>

<p>They marched into the garden thrumming bravely a
popular two-step march. It is the custom of the musicians
thus to arrive in full cry, as it were. Amongst the group was
the little Señor's nurse-maid bravely carrying through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
heat the inevitable baby. Later on the baby caused a
diversion by getting itself stung by a bee.</p>

<p>The arrival of the music drove Coneni to a pitch of excitement.
He brought out a drinking flask of wine. The flask
had a long slender spout, and the guests drank by pouring
the wine straight into their mouths, tilting their heads backwards.
I was afraid of this method, and to my disgrace had
to be given a glass. Tables and chairs, made of rough planking,
were brought from neighbouring huertas.</p>

<p>"Now," cried Coneni, "for some dancing."</p>

<p>The guitar and laud players sat down. They played a
polka, a common polka. And the girls and English-capped
youths danced a solemn polka. Then followed a schottische,
then another polka, then a murdered two-step.</p>

<p>Disappointment rushed upon us.</p>

<p>But where then was the Spanish dancing? Had this
infernal European mechanical civilization quite driven all
feeling from the land? Where were the jotas, the malagueñas,
the baturras?</p>

<p>"But," said Jan at last to Coneni, "can you not dance
a Spanish dance?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," cried Coneni. "Here, let us dance
a malagueña. It is my favourite dance. Come, who will
dance with me?"</p>

<p>But there was nobody amongst the girls who could dance
it. Mrs. Coneni said that she was too old and too fat. Nor
was there amongst the laud players one who could play a
malagueña, nor could the guitar player beat the <i>tempo</i>.</p>

<p>So in the end it was Jan who played the malagueña as
best he could, while Coneni, using his lank limbs with the
flexibility of a youth, danced in marvellous fashion. But he
soon tired of dancing solos.</p>

<p>We went home, headed by the band, seconded by Coneni's
son carrying for us a large green melon, followed by Coneni's
daughter loaded with a basket of figs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>We parted from the band at El Angel, we going up to
Verdolay, they going across to Alverca, but with the good-byes
the guitar playing girl said:</p>

<p>"Aha, but since you are so 'affectionate' to music we
will come and play to you this evening at your house."</p>

<p>When Encarnacion heard this, she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, beautiful! And I will ask all my friends and we
will dance. And I will bring all Mother's chairs."</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i158.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>We arranged all Encarnacion's mother's chairs in a neat
circle in our entrada and waited. Nine o'clock went by&mdash;no
music&mdash;ten passed and 10.30. At eleven o'clock we heard
the band far away on the Alverca road. It came musically
through the night. We had contrived an especial illumination
of candles, but our guests repudiated houses. They were too
hot. So in spite of any possible traffic the chairs were dragged
out into the middle of the road, and we had our concert
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not a very inspiring concert. At the opening
of it the young laud player handed his instrument to Jan,
demanding that it should be tuned. We discovered later that
quite a number of the minor village executants cannot tune
their own instruments. Jan, however, at this time knew
nothing about lauds. So the boy had to do the best he could
with it. He managed to worry the instrument more or less
into tune with itself, but the task of getting his laud accorded
with his sister's guitar was beyond his power. However, a
concert could not be disturbed for so trifling a matter; and
to the perfect satisfaction of the players, and, as far as we
could see, of the audience, the two instruments played until
about three o'clock in the morning, each one a semi-tone
different in pitch from the other.</p>

<p>We had provided bottles of wine for the occasion
at the cost of sixpence a bottle. This wine was the
ordinary drinking wine of the district. It speaks well of
the abstemiousness of the Spaniard that though we had at
least thirty guests about half a bottle of wine only was drunk.
The major part of the audience contented itself with cool
water from the algazarra.</p>

<p>Some time later on in the evening the players confided
to us that they were the pupils of a maestro who lived in
Alverca, and that they had only been studying for two months.
The fact that there was a teacher in Alverca fired me. I had
wanted to learn the laud for some while, but the opportunity
had not offered itself. I inquired his terms. The band said
that they were twopence-halfpenny a lesson. So I at once
told it to send the maestro along. At 3.30&mdash;after we had been
wondering for some time how much longer our eyes would
remain open&mdash;the band took its leave, saying that it would
come again one evening. It then marched, playing loudly, back
to Alverca.</p>

<p>The maestro sent word that he would come on Tuesday
evening. He was of that type of southern European that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
American terms "Dago." He was typically Dago. He was
a plumber by trade, and in the evening augmented his income
by odd twopence-halfpennies picked up from the would-be
"affectionates" of the guitar or laud. He loved wine with
a sincere though timid reverence. When she heard that he
was coming to give me a lesson, Encarnacion said:</p>

<p>"Oh, beautiful! And we will all come and listen to
your lesson, and afterwards we will dance."</p>

<p>But even Spain could not make me unselfconscious
enough to support that test. With grim harshness we locked
the door on our lessons.</p>

<p>The maestro, like Blas, considered two airs his daily
portion. At the end of the first air he would empty his
tumbler of wine, and would gently repudiate the idea that it
should be refilled. The third glass he accepted with quite
vehement protestations. His course homeward was, I fear,
usually more discursive than that of his coming. Like all
Spanish musicians he sang upon the slightest excuse. He
corrected my melody by singing: "Lo, La, Lo, La, Lo, La,"
as I played.</p>

<p>Having played the violin, the mandolin and the piano,
I did not find the laud very difficult. It has a queer tuning
in fourths and is played with the plectrum. But when La
Merchora discovered that I had learned a piece in two days
she was quite eloquent in her astonishment</p>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;THE LAUD</h4>


<p>During our month in Verdolay we had not quite cut off
communication with Murcia. Luis and his friend
Flores had come out to lunch with us, bringing with
them a slab of odoriferous dried fish which <i>they said</i> was
excellent in salads. On this occasion many families in Verdolay
had offered to cook our dinner for us, Encarnacion's mother,
the shopping woman, the woman who brought the water and
La Merchora were the principal competitors; and the dinner
was finally cooked out in the open in La Merchora's back-yard
in a huge frying-pan. We had also travelled the five dusty
miles into Murcia, walking, to the grave astonishment of
Verdolay plutocracy. On the first occasion Antonio told us
with a face of joy that his wife <i>was out of danger</i>.</p>

<p>"Out of danger," cried we; "but she was only suffering
from a small digestive attack!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Antonio; "didn't I tell you that she
had smallpox? Why, a man died of it three doors down the
street."</p>

<p>Before we had quitted Verdolay, Rosa (Antonio's wife)
was well enough to be moved, and Antonio had brought her
into the country to the Count's country house. She was
spotted like a pard with large brown marks which Antonio
assured us would disappear with time, leaving no pits.</p>

<p>On another visit Jan had gone into the shop of Emilio
Peralta to buy some guitar strings. The shop of Emilio was
not like that of Ramirez in Paris. It was set in a canyon of
a street so deep that the midday sun for one short hour or
so shines on the cobbles, so narrow that the carts which pass
through it are permitted to go in one sole direction marked at
the entrance by a pointing arrow. Ramirez had a workshop
only, but Emilio had as well on his working bench three brave
showcases painted apple green, one of which was filled with
instruments&mdash;guitars, lauds and bandurrias&mdash;with a drawer
for strings, capo-d'astros and other instrumental appurtenances.
Of the two other showcases, one housed the guitar-maker's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
tools, the third having degenerated to a pantry, and while one
was buying strings from Emilio, his wife would be surreptitiously
taking dishes of boiled garbanzos or of dried sardines
out of the garishly painted frand. The place was indeed
workshop, pantry and reception room. A counter cut the
place in two. To the left as you entered Emilio made his
instruments. To the right was a rough semicircle of chairs,
and here the <i>aficionados</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of the guitar came in the evening,
to play on Emilio's latest creation. To our dismay, however,
we found that the intensely interesting music of Spain, the
Flamenco, as it is called, was somewhat despised in Emilio's
shop. In Spain, music is divided to-day into the major
divisions, Classical and Flamenco. Classical includes anything
from Beethoven to Darewski, from Sonata or Symphony
to Fox-trot or Polka. The guitar-maker to-day says proudly:
"I do not make instruments for 'Flamenco,' mine are made
for 'Classical'": and he but echoes the bad taste of the
educated Spaniard. The Flamenco, the native music, having
perhaps a stronger character than any other Folk music in
Europe, is considered very vulgar; it is called "Tavern
Music," as "still lives" in painting are called "Tavern
pictures."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we were not to be seduced from our desire
to study the Flamenco, and for the purpose of continuing that
study I had been looking out for a laud which is peculiarly
adapted to the music, much of which was composed originally
upon this instrument. Hitherto I had been unable to find an
instrument which I had liked, for the ordinary lute is queer
in shape and rather harsh in quality. But the plumber-maestro
in Alverca had lent me an instrument&mdash;a laud of
simpler form and sweeter tone, called a sonora&mdash;which pleased
me.</p>

<p>Jan going into Emilio's shop had found there a newly
completed sonora, very like that of the little maestro's, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
better in quality. He engaged Emilio to keep it till we returned,
and Emilio said he would bring the Professor down to
play it for us to show off its qualities. On the evening of the
day on which we came back to Murcia we went to Emilio's
shop. The chairs were all set in their prim semicircle and
Emilio, round-shouldered and heavy-faced, sat us down while
he expatiated on the excellence of the workmanship and the
beauty of the tone of his instrument. He demanded sixty
pesetas for the instrument, but said that we might possibly
come to some friendly arrangement over the price, as he was
trying to popularize this form of laud. The little Professor
came in. He was a strange man. He was extremely emaciated,
with one eye destroyed and almost blind in the other,
dressed in <i>outré</i> style as though he were acting as jockey in
an impromptu charade. His flexible hands seemed almost
translucent in their delicacy. He at once addressed us with
such rapidity of speech that we were unable to understand
what he said (though our understanding of Spanish had made
great progress), and he was extremely irritable with us for
seeming so stupid. This frail, delicate, peering thing was a
queer contrast to the burly, almost clumsy form of Emilio.</p>

<p>The little Professor picked up the sonora, and passed it
backwards and forwards slowly beneath his short-sighted
eye. He sat down and played. His nimble fingers ran up
and down the strings. We had almost decided to begin the
delicate matter of bargaining when a fat form, white-waist-coated,
straw hat perched jauntily over an Egyptian face,
showed itself in the doorway. It was Blas. And Blas was
drunk. He bowed in an heroic manner to me, shook hands in
simulated affection with Jan; and, his soul obviously consumed
with jealousy, greeted the little Professor, who returned his
salutation with coldness.</p>

<p>"Go on," ordered Blas to the little Professor, "play."
The little man put the sonora again on his thigh. One
could almost hear his teeth grit. Then he began to show off.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
He possessed a very effective trick of playing intricate runs
by the mere beat of the fingers of his left hand, that is without
plucking the strings with his right. This he now exhibited
to its full. He was on his mettle, Greek and Trojan were
face to face. Blas, seated on his chair, his fat hands on his
knees, smiled a drunken and somewhat patronizing approval of
his rival's exhibition.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i165.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>The little Professor finished his exhibition, which the
gipsy did not attempt to rival, for he played only the guitar.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
For a moment there was an embarrassing silence. The
gentle art of bargaining was about to displace the art of music.
But we had reckoned without the half-drunken Blas.</p>

<p>Suddenly rising to his feet he faced Jan, and rubbing
his finger and thumb together he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now comes the main point. The brass. Now is the
question of cashing up for it."</p>

<p>Doubtless this was a frank statement of fact. But three-quarters
of life continues bearable enough because one does
not put things frankly. Emilio changed colour and put on a
sullen face, Emilio's wife looked alarmed, Jan was embarrassed,
the little Professor seemed to wither into a crouching shape of
half his normal smallness.</p>

<p>But Blas went on in a breezy voice to Jan:</p>

<p>"Come on, come on. What's the matter? You suggest
a price to him and he will tell you if it fits."</p>

<p>Emilio's delicacy was quite revolted by this crude exhibition
of gipsy bad taste. He seized the laud from the little
Professor, thrust it on one side and said loudly that he did not
want to sell it at all.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jan was afraid of offending Emilio's
susceptibility. Not knowing how to behave in the unfortunate
circumstances, he blurted out:</p>

<p>"Look here, Emilio, you said sixty pesetas. Will you
not come down a little, and then we could settle the matter?"</p>

<p>Emilio was, however, extremely bad-tempered by the turn
things had taken. The Spanish sense of decency was outraged.
At last, with an evil look at Blas, he muttered:</p>

<p>"Well, fifty-five pesetas. Not a penny less and no more
bargaining."</p>

<p>Jan, to cut the scene short, agreed. The instrument
was wrapped up in a paper bag. While Jan was paying over
the money, Blas said:</p>

<p>"And you will give five pesetas to this gentleman, who is
a poor man: and five pesetas to me also."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>He seized five pesetas of the money from the counter and
pressed them on the little Professor. The latter, with girlish
giggles, refused; but Blas, with the insistence of a drunkard,
pressed his desire until, to quieten him, the little Professor
slipped the money into his waistcoat pocket. Blas then
demanded his own commission, saying that as he had been
Jan's Professor, and as Jan had once mentioned the subject
of the laud to him, he was fully entitled to his claim. But
Jan, outwardly calm, inwardly annoyed with Blas, would not
give him a halfpenny. At last Blas was begging:</p>

<p>"Well, at least give me a peseta to get a drink with."</p>

<p>"You have had enough drink already," said Jan.</p>

<p>He picked up the laud, and with farewells to Emilio, his
wife and the little Professor we walked out of the shop,
pushing our way through the crowd which had gathered at
the shop door.</p>

<p>On the following day we returned to Emilio's shop to
apologize for the contretemps. We found both Emilio and
his wife very disturbed by what had happened. They said
that their regrets were eternal, and that it would have been
better had we deferred the business matter until a better
occasion.</p>

<p>"It was a disgraceful affair," said Emilio, "disgraceful;
and to cap it all, after you had gone, Blas was most outrageous.
We had actually to pay him two pesetas to go away."</p>

<p>"We were afraid for our lives," said Mrs. Emilio. "He
is a bad man, and one never knows what rogues he might have
brought upon us."</p>

<p>Though Jan did not believe much in the active danger
of Blas, yet the terror of Emilio and of his wife was quite
evident. So in the end he disbursed the five pesetas given to
the little Professor as well as the two given to Blas. So that
our laud actually cost us sixty-two pesetas, instead of the
sixty for which we might have bought it without any bargaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>With the little Professor we had made an engagement for
the afternoon. He was to give me a lesson on which I could
study while we were away at Jijona. He came, feeling his
way up our staircase. He shook hands with us and said that
the affair of last night had greatly oppressed his spirit.</p>

<p>"I felt it much in my heart," he said.</p>

<p>We explained to him that we were going away for a month,
but that we would return to Murcia later, and that when we
returned I would take lessons from him.</p>

<p>"My price," he exclaimed (all his speech was exclamation),
"is one duro a month. I am not one of those villains who
charge one price to one person and a different price to another.
No, my price is fixed and unalterable. One duro, five pesetas,
a month."</p>

<p>Now, although this little man was probably as good a
teacher as could be found in the town of Murcia, his price
averaged about <i>twopence a lesson</i>.</p>

<p>We discovered later that the laud suffers not only from a
ban of "bad taste," but also from a moral one. To-day its
use in Spain is almost limited to the playing of dance music
in houses of bad fame</p>

<h4>ALICANTE</h4>


<p>Our second experience in Spanish village life was to be at
Jijona, a small town in the country near Alicante. Our
friend had what he called a studio there, and this was
at our service. Luis said that there was furniture in the studio
but no cooking utensils or bed. After our packing-case bed in
Verdolay, we determined to take with us nothing but a mattress
and either to sleep on the floor or to buy planks locally. So
we had packed our trunk with painting materials, crockery
and clothes. We had also made up a large roll of bedclothes
and mattress such as emigrants travel with. Having risen
with the dawn, our preparations were complete by the time
at which the donkeyman who peddled drinking-water about
the streets of Murcia called for us with his long cart. He was
not quite satisfied with our roll, and with expert hands repacked
it in a professional manner. But his long water-cart would
only take our trunk and the rolled mattress, so, burdened with
rucksacks, camera, guitar, thermos flasks and a rush basket
containing crockery which would not pack into the trunk,
and the laud, we walked the quarter of a mile to the station.
Thus burdened, we expected more staring and laughter than
before from the Murcianos, but, to our amazement, the people
looked upon us with kindly eyes and wished us God-speed.
Thus Spain reverses the manner of England.</p>

<p>Jan took his place in the ticket queue while I, assisted by
a friendly porter, looked for seats in a third-class carriage.
The carriages were full enough despite the fact that we were
in good time. Large numbers of children seemed to be
travelling, and many of the passengers were stretched out on the
wooden seats, taking a snooze before the train should start.
The divisions between the compartments were only breast
high, and already animated conversations had begun between
the passengers who, from different compartments, shouted
remarks to each other. In our compartment were a sandalled
peasant stretched at full length, a bearded man with a huge
brass plate on his breast and a shot-gun, evidently a gamekeeper,
and a smart young man with patent leather boots and
a straw hat. The last was reading a hook. On the platform
we noted an important priest striding about, his black soutane
covered with a silk dust-coat, and an old woman with a posy of
bright flowers about twice as big as her head. The train was
the centre of an excited crowd, the carriage full almost to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
bursting-point. As the time for departure came near most of
those we had imagined to be our fellow passengers got slowly
down on to the platform; all the children disappeared. They
had merely been taking advantage of the train's presence in
the station to take a rest.</p>

<p>The three strokes on the bell, which denote the starting
of the train, had sounded when our carriage door was flung
open and a panting bundle of humanity was thrust upwards
and amongst us. As the train moved out, it resolved itself
into a small woman, very loquacious, carrying in her arms
three babies. Talking very excitedly, she laid her brood out
on a wooden seat. The woman was-black-haired and her jet
eyes sparkled with excitement.</p>

<p>"They are bandits," she exclaimed. "Yes, bandits they
are, rushing about like that. I was with my children in
Uncle Pepe's donkey-cart. Then they come along. Of course
the bullocks in the stone waggon in front wouldn't move quick
enough, and so they come tearing across the road, flip us under
the axle, and over we all go into the dust. Uncle Pepe
strained his wrist and the shaft is broken. And that's the
way they treat us just after my poor husband has died of smallpox.
It's lucky that nobody was killed and that I didn't
lose the train. Murderers, that's what they are."</p>

<p>We noted that she and her babies were covered with dust,
and that she was dressed all in black even to her alpagatas.
While she had been talking so volubly she had been unpacking
a basket which, with the bundles, had been thrust in after
her. She got out a bottle of water and a piece of rag. With a
moistened rag she tried to wash the babies, but made rather
a smeary mess of it. The occupants of the other compartments
were leaning over sympathizing with her mishap. But,
as she had omitted the cause of the mishap, somebody
questioned her.</p>

<p>"Why, motors, of course," she snapped. "It's murderous
the way they go rushing about. Not caring for any one, and
not waiting to see what damage they have done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>As most of the carriage occupants seemed to be peasantry,
they agreed with her. Somebody went on:</p>

<p>"And are those all you have?"</p>

<p>The young woman drew herself up with pride. "No,"
she answered, "I've got four, and all men too."</p>

<p>The train was rolling with a determined manner down the
Murcian valley. On one side the bills drew closer, on the
other they were receding. We noted that all the carriage
doors were left swinging wide open to admit as much air as
possible. Presently there was a noise outside and the ticket-collector
scrambled into the carriage. He examined all
the tickets in our coach, and swung himself again out on to the
footboard, making his way slowly forward. Some of the
passengers, too, who had friends in other carriages made
visits <i>en route</i>, scrambling along the moving train. And the
carriage doors had notices on them saying: "It is dangerous
to put the head out of the window."</p>

<p>After an hour or more of sedate travel, we came to
Orihuela, which boasts a huge monastery on the hill and a
broad zigzag road which looked like an engineering feat.
The station was like a flower shop. Vendors were running up
and down the train thrusting elaborate bouquets into the
windows. Some women dressed in royal blue satin came into
our carriage, they stuffed unfortunate live poultry and rabbits,
with feet tied up, under the seat and covered the wooden bench
of the compartment with magnificent flowers. During the
rest of the journey, the monotonous flip, click of their fans
as they were opened and shut punctuated the conversation.</p>

<p>We passed through the famous date palm groves of Elche
and at last came in sight of the sea at Alicante, which was our
terminus. The journey of about forty-five miles had taken
us nearly four hours, and we were almost an hour and a half
late. Time-tables are more or less ornamental in Spain.</p>

<p>Outside the station at Alicante there was a horde of
omnibuses surrounded by a fringe of touts. They were
conducting their chaffering for passengers with a reasonable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
quietness, until they espied us. But perceiving that we were
English and, therefore, fair prey, pandemonium broke out.
Gradually the omnibuses filled and the babel, for babel it
was, consisting of Spanish, Valenciano, bad French and worse
English, died down. Two omnibus touts, however, persisted,
and at last, in order to prevent battle between them, we chose
our man for his looks. He promised to take us to the fonda
from which started the motor service to Jijona.</p>

<p>We had been warned by our English friend that it was
often difficult to get seats on the motor, because the conveyance
started from Jijona and many of the passengers
booked return tickets. The omnibus tout added to this that
there was a fiesta at Jijona, and that many people were
going there. However, he said:</p>

<p>"If there are no seats in the motor, we will surely get
them on the lorry, which will do just as well and is
cheaper."</p>

<p>The omnibus was full with an unsmiling family, but we
were crushed in. We were dragged along beneath a magnificent
avenue of date palm trees which bordered the deep blue
expanse of the Mediterranean, and then into streets of modern
and of bad architecture. The family got out and paid the
driver. Jan strained his eyes to see how much was the price,
for we had foolishly made no bargain with the driver. As far
as he could see most was paid in coppers. We then passed up
into narrow and steep streets and halted before a wide door.
The tout got down, but returned almost immediately, saying
that the motor was full for two days.</p>

<p>"The motor-lorry is better," he said.</p>

<p>With some difficulty the bus was turned round in the
narrow street and we went downhill again, coming at length
to the entrance of another fonda. We passed through its
broad entrance and at a small office window interviewed an
old man who said that there was room in the lorry but that
he did not know when it was going. So we deposited our
luggage in the wide entrance, amongst packing-cases, sacks
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of flour, mattresses and japanned boxes. We then asked the
price of the bus from the tout.</p>

<p>"Seven pesetas," he said.</p>

<p>The whole drive had not taken twenty minutes, and Jan
was sure that the other family of four had not paid more than
two pesetas for the lot. After some argument and much
blasphemy from the driver, we paid five pesetas, and the bus
drove off vomiting curses at us from both driver and tout.
(On the return journey from Jijona we happened on the same
bus, but we made our bargain beforehand. The same trip
then cost us two pesetas, and was accomplished with smiles
instead of curses, and both driver and tout clapped us on the
shoulder and wished us: "Vaya con dios.")</p>

<p>This fonda was a typical peasant inn. The entrance door
which pierced through a block of buildings was big enough to
admit a full-sized traction engine, had there been such a thing
in Alicante. This wide passage led into a big courtyard
open to the skies. On each side of the courtyard a staircase
led to balconies from which opened the doors of the bedrooms,
below were the dark stables, and the courtyard itself was filled
with the large two-wheeled tilted carts which, dragged by
from two to eight draught animals, keep up communications
in Spain wherever the railway does not penetrate. To the
right of the entrance was the fonda restaurant, and also a
huge kitchen with several cooking fires at which the traveller,
if he wished, could cook his own meals, and a long dining-table
at which he could eat them. We went into the restaurant, for
we were hungry. To our table came an old couple. They
were at once friendly and told us that they had come from
Africa. They were Spanish but had lived more than thirty
years in North Africa, and though the old man could neither
read nor write he could speak several African dialects quite
well. They were making a pleasure tour of the south of
Spain for a short holiday. They told us that the fonda was
quite clean, and that we could take a room in it without fear.
They added that though Murcia was but "a dirty village"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the fonda there had been clean also, but that at Guadix they
had been eaten alive.</p>

<p>Our dinner finished, we sat ourselves down on a bench in
the entrada and looked about us.</p>

<p>To one side of the entrance was a small stall which sold
iced drinks. Men and women were sitting in after-lunch ease
amid the boxes and sacks which lined the opposite wall, on
low chairs, or on the bench with us. A dog, shaved all over
its body, partly because of the heat, partly to keep off the
fleas with which all Spanish animals are infested, was asleep
on our mattress. The proprietor of the fonda was standing
in a lordly manner in the middle of the floor. He was dressed
in white shirt and flannel trousers, and must have weighed
almost sixteen stone, although quite young. He looked as if
he had been inflated with air.</p>

<p>We had noticed, though we have not before mentioned, a
curious illness which seems prevalent in Spain. In Murcia
were large numbers of monstrous children; boys and girls
had reached enormous proportions before the age of ten years
old. We came to the conclusion that it was a form of illness,
because, though the children seemed healthy enough, we have
never seen this development of monstrosity elsewhere, nor
did large numbers of them appear to survive adolescence,
though there were a certain number of excessively fat girls.
The proprietor was such a monstrosity grown up. His wife,
a dark-eyed beauty, was sitting in a rocking-chair near the
kitchen door and her baby of about three years old, standing
in its mother's lap, was having a great lark, pretending to catch
lice in its mother's head. Thus do our ideas of innocent
sports for children differ from those of other nations.</p>

<p>There was some coming and going amongst the fonda
visitors. The guests seemed to be all peasants, the men in
blouses, the women in pale skirts, black blouses and shawls
of paisley pattern over the shoulders. Many had bundles of
towels and of bathing dresses. One group we heard saying
that they had come down to Alicante for a week's sea bathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>As the afternoon drew on and the lorry delayed, we again
interviewed the old man, who answered that probably it
would not come that day. Accordingly, we spoke to the
proprietor, who rather roughly said that we could have a room
for two pesetas a night. The room was small, and the bed
only just big enough for two. There were two doors, one
leading into the interior of the inn, one out on to a balcony.
The latter was half of glass and had no lock, and as there was
plenty of traffic along the balcony, which was used for drying
linen, underclothes and bathing dresses, one only had a chance
of privacy by closing the shutters, leaving oneself in the dark,
and no chance of sleeping with the window open despite the
heat. But Spain does not believe in open windows or doors
at night; it has "a robber complex."</p>

<p>We put our small luggage into the bedroom, leaving the
large trunk and the roll of mattress in the entrada. We then
went out to explore the town and to find a young painter to
whom we carried an introduction from Luis. Emilio, for
such was his name, was one of the lucky ones of this world.
His parents kept a wine-shop which relieved him of a pressing
need of earning a living. He could thus study at his ease.
Our investigations took us through a shop full of large barrels,
up some narrow stairs and on to a landing where two girls
were working at pillow lace. Emilio received us with a brusque
cordiality, showed us some of his work, which had talent,
came back to the inn with us, where he arranged for our
transport by the lorry whenever it should arrive, and said
that he would also find a carter to take our heavier luggage
out on a road waggon. This readiness to help a stranger,
often at considerable personal effort, we found characteristic
of the parts of Spain which we have visited.</p>

<p>Emilio, having an engagement, left us, and we strolled
through the town. To the east lies the older part of the Port
clambering up the rugged side of the steep rock, at the top of
which lies the castle. The fishing village, at the extreme end
of Alicante, is beautiful with its small primitive cubic houses
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
painted in garish patterns. Through steeply sloping streets
we came to the beach. Here were Mediterranean fishing boats
drawn up in ranks; then, as we returned towards the
harbour, more open beach covered with people in gay dresses
and children playing on the sands. Then came the bathing
establishments built out on piles over the tideless sea. The
bathing establishments increased in luxury towards the town
and were, for the most part, fantastic wooden erections of
Moorish design. We came back to the broad double avenue
of palm trees which faced the more luxurious hotels and cafés.</p>

<p>Night came softly on, and one by one amongst the palms the
lights of the town threw beams over the chattering people
who strolled in ever-thickening processions to and fro beneath
the palm trees; mingled with the conversation was the incessant
click, click of the fans of the girls and women. We went
back to the fonda for supper and afterwards returned to the
sea front. The cafés had spread tables beneath the palms,
and we sat down enjoying our "Blanco y negro," an iced
drink composed half of white cream ice flavoured with vanilla,
and half of iced coffee.</p>

<p>Bands of musical beggars assailed us. Most of the mendicants
were blind. One group, a veritable orchestra, travelled
from café to café clinging to the edges of a bass viol which the
one seeing member, the money collector, dragged the way it
should go, by the peg-head. There was an old guitarist who
played and made queer noises through a small gazoo. Another
orchestra of three, guitar, laud and bandurria, the latter
instrument a small cousin of the laud, and in this case played
beautifully by a blind boy of about nineteen years. There
were other beggars too, but the devil of cheap European music
had entered into them all. Not one played their own native
Spanish music. I suppose nobody would pay to hear it played.</p>

<p>At the end of the palm avenue an artist had set up an
easel on a raised dais. His work was illuminated by a
strong acetylene gas lamp. The canvas was painted bright
sparrow's egg blue and surrounded by a frame of staring gilt.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

  </table>
</div>

<p>On the blue canvas he was painting an imaginary landscape,
the blue serving as sky and for the waters of a still lake. A
drab woman was threading her way to and fro through the
crowd which surrounded him, crying out: "The numbers,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the numbers. Who would like to win a magnificent picture,
framed complete for ten chances a penny?"</p>

<p>Another crowd surrounded a buck nigger who, displaying
his magnificent and gleaming teeth, was crying out the virtues
of his dentifrice.</p>

<p>A third crowd listened to a quack doctor who, backed by a
large picture depicting the jungle, was selling a specific called
"African Tonic." The tonic, he said, was derived from essences
extracted at enormous expense from the tiger, the elephant,
the monkey, and from I know not what else. From time to time
he rested his voice by turning on a squeaky gramophone.</p>

<p>Tired from our journey we went to bed betimes.</p>

<p>We got up early. In the waggons, which were lined up in
the big courtyard, the families which had slept in them were
making their toilet. In the entrada, the old man of the inn,
aided by the stable boy, was packing away the hammock beds
slung from trestles, on which slept those travellers who, having
no waggon, did not wish to pay the expense of a bedroom.</p>

<p>We had noted small café stalls near to the market, so,
in order to see some more of Alicante life, we took our breakfast
there rather than in the fonda. The café stalls were wooden
box-like kiosks, and they spread wicker chairs and tables over
the open street, and soldiers and workmen were sitting sipping
their morning refreshment. Beneath the shelter of the kiosk
a lad was making the day's supply of ice cream. The cream
is frozen by the amount of heat absorbed from it by the
freezing mixture. One might also say that the amount of
refreshment to be derived from ice cream seems proportionate
to the amount of energy absorbed from the lad who manufactures
it: it appeared a fatiguing business. Crowds of
people on the way to market passed us, and to where we sat
came the cries of the market salesmen. We were not stared
at here as we had been in Murcia. Strangers were evidently
more common.</p>

<p>A small boy stationed himself near our table gazing
longingly at a breakfast roll. To all intents and purposes he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
hypnotized it from the table into his hand. He broke into
unexpected French. His father, like so many Spaniards,
had been working at Lyons during the war. He deplored the
fact that he had no education, but said that he was trying to
learn some English from the sailors who came to Alicante.
He had begun with the swear words, of which already he had a
fair collection. He said that his father was a bootmaker, out
of work, and asked if we had any boots to mend. He wheedled
also some cigarettes and a few coppers from us.</p>

<p>Emilio, who had sent off our heavy luggage on the previous
night as he had promised, met us, and together we went to a
café on the front, where we wrote a letter to Antonio saying
that we had left our passports behind by accident. In spite
of this oversight we had decided to push on to Jijona and to
trust to luck.</p>

<p>After lunch we again sat down in the fonda wondering if
the motor-lorry would come. Many peasants also were
there. Motor omnibuses drove in, but these were destined
for other parts. Opposite the bus office was a gambling
machine, into which one pushed a penny and if one were
lucky received back twopence, fourpence, sixpence or even
tenpence. But this machine had gone wrong, and the bulky
proprietor spent the greater part of the afternoon over it
with a screw-driver. A drunkard was staggering up and down,
now shouting, now singing, now dancing a few unsteady steps.
The stable boys were making a butt of him. Presently he
sat down on a sack and fell asleep, his head tilted back, his
mouth open. The opportunity was too good to miss.</p>

<p>Pulling out his sketch book, Jan began to make a sketch.
The old ticket-office man, perceiving what Jan was doing,
leaned over his shoulder, and as the sketch developed began
to chuckle. Soon there was a double queue of spectators,
giggling with suppressed laughter, stretching on each side
from Jan to the drunkard across the width of the entrada.
When the drawing was finished, the old man exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that is excellent; will you not give it to me, Señor?"</p>

<p>Jan made of the drawing a rapid tracing which pleased
the old man as much as the original.</p>

<p>"I'll keep that," said the old man.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i181.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>To our horror he walked across the entrada, with a thump
in the ribs awoke the drunkard, and showed him the sketch.
Gradually, as he realized what had been done, an expression
of wrath grew on the drunkard's face. Luckily for us, he
became possessed of the idea that the drawing had been done
by one of the stable boys. No one undeceived him and,
amidst roars of laughter, he addressed a long speech to the
stable boy in question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"The rights of man," said the drunkard, "are inalienable,
and of all the rights of man, the greatest right is that of his
person. The stable boy has, therefore, transgressed against
the most sacred of men's rights. I could have excused most
things," went on the drunkard, "but this is inexcusable; to
inflict indignity on a man in his own person. Since neither the
stable boy nor the spectators of this crime seem sensible of
the enormity they have committed, the only act by which I
can express the contempt which I feel for the meanness of
your natures is that of removing myself from the company of
such low mortals."</p>

<p>Having thus delivered himself with the air of a Demosthenes,
he literally shook the dust from the soles of his
alpagatas and staggered out into the street. Coincident with
the departure of the drunkard was the arrival of the Jijona
motor-lorry.</p>

<p>The lorry was heavy, with solid tyres. Michelin's motor
guide had described the route as: "Cart road bad and very
indisposed," and we wondered what the sixteen miles would
value as experience. We all scrambled in, arranging our
luggage as best we could on our laps or under the narrow
wooden benches nailed to the lorry's sides. The centre of the
lorry was occupied with cargo, in this case barrels, some full,
some empty, standing on end. We thought that we had all
fitted in so nicely, but a wail from the courtyard drew our
attention to an old woman who, loaded with parcels and almost
weeping with despair, had failed to find a seat. We said
"Move up" to each other, but no moving up was possible.
The old man came out in anger from the ticket-office.</p>

<p>"But this is ridiculous," he shouted; "there is room,
there are so many seats on the lorry, I sell so many seats,
therefore there must be room."</p>

<p>Slowly the elucidation of the mystery dawned on us. Three
of our passengers were of such girth that each ought in common
fairness to have booked two seats for himself. So with much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
effort we squeezed and shoved into the fat men until we gained
a narrow slit of seat into which the little old woman was
dropped. But immediately the active pressure was released
the resilience of fat reasserted itself, and the little old woman
spent the first part of the journey moaning out that she was
being crushed to death. Most of the voyagers were peasants;
one or two were travellers going to the fiesta; one was dressed
in soldier's uniform, but he seemed to be neither officer nor
private. We discovered later that he was a veterinary
surgeon. Our musical instrument caused some attention
and our fellow voyagers smiled at us with sympathy and
kindness.</p>

<p>"Are you artists?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," we replied.</p>

<p>"Then we will come to your concert," said they.</p>

<p>The road was indeed "indisposed." We rolled, rocked,
and bumped along miles of dusty road, by the side of which the
trees were so drenched in dust that they were but ghosts of
themselves; the herbage below seeming like the delicate
clay work of a magic potter, having no hint of green for the
eye. Nor can empty barrels be considered good travelling
companions. If the lorry were toiling uphill the barrels
sidled down the floor with a seeming leer. One snatched one's
toes out of the way without ceremony. On reaching the end
of the lorry, the barrels spread themselves sideways, crushing
the knees of the sitters. When the lorry reached the top of
the hill and began to thunder down the new slope the barrels
bounced and bumped to the other end of the lorry, bruising
everybody in their passage. Finally the young soldier sat
on one of the centre barrels and tried to quell their antics,
without much success.</p>

<p>The lorry climbed into the mountains, round roads which
curved like a whiplash. At one spot the young soldier
remarked: "The motor-bus fell over here once; six of the
passengers were killed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>The sun beat down on the canvas top of the lorry, and the
large white porous water-jug hanging at the end was in constant
demand. We halted at a small and lonely house where beer
was for sale. The passengers also bought beans pickled in
salt and handed them to each other.</p>

<p>The dusty miles rolled off, at one moment through grey cliffs
which shone in the evening light, and another over deep water courses,
along the bottom of which ran serried terraces of
vines. Presently a pretty girl, whom we took to be the daughter
of a wealthy farmer, and who had spent the better part of
the journey flirting with the young soldier, exclaimed:
"Mira! Shishona!"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Through a cleft between two mountains we caught a
glimpse of distant houses clustered up the side of a hill towards
an old Saracen ruin which gleamed ochreous against the evening
sky.</p>

<p>In spite of the presence of a couple of factories, the entrance
of Jijona from the south is one of the most romantic sights we
have seen in Spain. Ancient Spanish buildings sprang from
the edge of a ravine covered with prickly pear, and faced a
steep cliff, along the precipitous face of which ran water courses.
Old houses stood step above step, on a hill so steep
that the roadways were all staircases and the houses had two
entrances, the front into the lowest story and the back into
the upper, and often the back-yard was higher than the roof.
A white stone bridge carried the road with a noble curve across
the ravine, and round this curve we swung, the passengers
waving hands and shouting greetings, into the town.</p>

<p>Our destination was a casa de huespedes (half inn, half
boarding-house) called "La Vinaigre," and the name was not
altogether unsuitable. But our first reception was as cordial
as we could have wished. Owing to our friend's mattress,
which the old hostess had recognized, we were welcomed with
open arms.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

<h4>JIJONA&mdash;THE FIESTA</h4>


<p>The only fiesta we had hitherto experienced in Spain
had been a small peasant feast during an afternoon at
Verdolay. We had gone to it; but finding that we as
foreigners constituted the chief centre of interest, we had
run away to the seclusion of our house. At the big fiesta
of Jijona were so many strangers that we were almost
overlooked.</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

</div>

<p>The family at the "Vinegar" consisted of an old bent-backed
father peasant, sandalled; a mother, in black with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
black shawl; several sons, reaching towards mercantile
gentility owing to the turron factory, which was in the cellars
of the house; and several daughters, most of whom had
married personages of importance in the little town. In
fact the "Vinegar" family was upon the up-grade. They
promised us a week of unparalleled amusement.</p>

<p>First, they said the town was crammed with people&mdash;a
most necessary concomitant to Spanish enjoyment. In no
other country in the world is the gregarious nature of man so
plainly exhibited. The man who plays his lonely golf matched
with an imaginary colonel would not be understood; your
solitary pleasurer would find no sympathizers. Crowds,
crowds, form the oil in the salad of Spanish amusement.
Secondly: that very night the priests were giving a free
public cinema entertainment. Thirdly: "They will loose a
cow on the streets to-morrow night. Oh, it is precioso. It
is a wonderful diversion. The cow gallops, the men try to
catch her. They are tossed right and left, others come to
the rescue. Magnificent! Eh?" Fourthly: the old drama
of the Moors and Christians was to be performed.</p>

<p>Jijona lies in territory once captured by the Moors. They
say that the original name was Saracena, and to-day locally
it is pronounced "Shishona." It owes its considerable
wealth to the extensive terrace cultivation of almonds, by
means of which the hard-working Moors converted the
mountains from barrenness to fertility.</p>

<p>"There is a castle of boards erected in the plaza," said
the Vinegars; "this will be stormed first by the Moors, then
by the Christians. It is very luxurious. Not so luxurious
as last year, perhaps, because the captains of the fiesta are
not so wealthy as those of last year, and owing to the tobacco
famine, the Contrabandistas will omit their drama of tobacco
smuggling. Yet it will exhibit much lujo."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>At supper we tasted for the first time the famous turron
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of Jijona. This was manufactured by our hosts. It is a
crisp, dry, almond sweetmeat, probably Moorish in origin, for
it is not unlike Halva de Smyrne and carries behind its almond
flavour a queer but not unpleasant taste resembling the
smell of an over-heated chair. Supper over, we went out to
the plaza. The first need of Spanish amusement had been
fulfilled. The streets were crowded. A few of the more
sophisticated visitors were even wearing hats.</p>

<p>At the far end of the plaza, dimly, could be seen the
wooden castle, in shape not unlike one of those quaint wood cuts
from an old edition of Froissart; some distance in front
of it, high in the air, was the sheet on which the free "pictures"
were to be thrown from the topmost pinnacle of the castle.
As the time of the performance drew near, the people came
bringing chairs with them until both before and behind the
screen the plaza was crammed. The performance was not a
success. The illumination was dim; the sheet stretched high
above the people's heads. In addition, a young moon in its
first quarter intruded from above the mountain-tops. This
intrusive crescent, shining almost through the centre of the
sheet, sometimes took the place of the heroine's head, sometimes
of the hero's waistcoat. After straining our eyes for a
while, having reflected on gift-horses and teeth we went back
to the Vinegars' and to bed. As we went we wondered what
those spectators who were on the wrong side of the sheet
and who in consequence could not read the legends&mdash;if they
were able to read&mdash;would construe out of those dim dramas.</p>

<p>We awoke on the morrow eager to see what the "Studio"
of our friend was like. Father Vinegar had gone before us,
but Mother Vinegar took the road and showed us up through
tortuous and romantic staircases of streets, up&mdash;up&mdash;until we
reached the highest level of the town. But our friend's
house was yet higher. We clambered up a zigzag path over
a widening hill-side to the crest of the ridge. There on the
top, fronting the ruins of the old Saracen fortress, was our
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
friend's house "El Torre de Blay." It was a long house of
one story, backed by a round tower of three stories. The
tower was claimed to be Saracen in origin: it overlooked a
walled yard, which was filled with chickens, rabbits and
turkeys, for the Vinegars were using the house during the
absence of our friend. A pile of almond shells was in the
entrada and a back door led out into a terraced garden full
of pomegranate, pear, fig, almond and olive trees and grape
vines. Old Vinegar, called locally "Père Chicot," led us
round, discoursing on the beauty of the house, which was
indeed cool, large and airy. But the <i>clou</i> of the house Père
Chicot kept till the last. With a gesture of profound pride
he swung open a small door.</p>

<p>"Señor and Señora," he exclaimed, "I will warrant that
there is not a W.C. to compare with this in the whole province
of Alicante."</p>

<p>Mother Vinegar, talking in a high-pitched, querulous voice,
was complaining of the rise in prices, of the hardness of the
season. The garden of the Torre, she said, was not worth
looking after, there were no grapes, and as for the almonds,
she went on, pointing to a small heap, that was the whole
crop for the year. She added that only a little while ago
somebody had broken into the yard and had stolen two
hundred and fifty pesetas' worth of poultry and rabbits.</p>

<p>It occurred to us that some of her cordiality to us came
from the fact that she looked on us to make up some of that
lost money. So I gently led her on to the question of ways
and means. She said:</p>

<p>"Oh, El Señor used this place as a working place only.
He lived and slept at our house, and for that he paid ten
pesetas a day."</p>

<p>Now El Señor (our English friend) had told us that he
paid seven pesetas. Our suspicions were correct. I am
afraid that in the end Mrs. Vinegar, like the undertaker
in Tcheckov's story, counted us amongst her losses. Her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
manner changed gradually from cordial to chilly: she had
promised to help me to shop, but she put obstacles in my
way and also, I believe, tried to prevent us from finding a
servant. Finally we made an arrangement that Mrs. Vinegar
should supply us with meals at two pesetas fifty each. Remembering
that Elias had fed us in Murcia for one peseta
fifty I struggled to reduce the price to two pesetas for less
food, but Mrs. Vinegar said that Jijona was far more expensive
than Murcia (as a matter of fact it was, if anything, cheaper),
and that the reputation of her house would not stand a lower
price. Finally, to her disgust, I announced that we could
not afford more than three meals a week at that rate, and
we were accordingly scrawled down, heavily underlined, with
red ink, amongst the stolen chickens and rabbits.</p>

<p>But the idea of the cow chase through the streets excited
us. As in the well-known story, the cow turned out to be a
bull; nor was the chase to be in the narrow winding streets,
but in the plaza, the entrances of which had been blocked up
with extempore barricades of wooden beams. The women
and the less courageous of the men were to fill the balconies,
and places in a balcony had been found for us by the Vinegar
girls, who were quite different in manners from their parents.
The bulls were stabled at the back of the town; and, like a
wasp in a spider's web, plunging at the ends of long ropes tied
to its horns, the bull was dragged to the plaza, when it was
insinuated into a rough bull-pen erected near the castle.
There were three bulls, and a second was thus dragged up
and penned in. The third, however, was tied to a tree, and
pads, like boxing-gloves, were fixed solidly to its murderous
horns. Then with some precautions the bull was loosened.
The game was a sort of ticky-touchwood. Home in this
case was anywhere out of reach of the bull's tossing
capacity: open doors, the ironwork of windows, water pipes,
trees, the barricades of the streets, lamp posts, a fountain&mdash;around
which one could dodge&mdash;and a wall topped by a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
rickety pailing, and the woodwork of some swing-boats near
the castle.</p>

<p>Jan had gone down into the plaza to get some photos.
From the balcony the game was exciting, though not furious.
Some of the boys showed considerable pluck; and it was
amusing to watch the strange concavities shown in the back
of one running away who thought that the bull was close
behind and who could feel in imagination those horns
prodding his spine.</p>

<div align="center">

      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i190.jpg" width="350" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>But the fun was not furious enough to bear long watching
from the balcony. So I went down into the square and
joined Jan. I had several reasons for this action. I was
bored, and thought it would be more exciting below. But the
chief idea I had was that by this manœuvre I would be able
to introduce myself to Jijona <i>en bloc</i>. I should be universally
known, and would thus escape the continual shrieks and
giggles with which strangers greeted my appearance. So I
went down into the plaza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>A loud gasp went up from the crowds.</p>

<p>Some youths ran up to me.</p>

<p>"Señora, Señora," they cried, "you mustn't stay here.
It is dangerous!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked I.</p>

<p>"But don't you understand? The bull! He might get
you."</p>

<p>"But," I answered, "he might get you too."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we can run."</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i191.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>"Well, I can run also."</p>

<p>At this moment theory turned hurriedly into practice.
The bull came charging down upon us. Jan and I with a
number of youths made a run for the wall, clambered on to
it, and clung there, hanging on its rickety pailings, while the
bull smelt our toes.</p>

<p>"Curse you! Curse you!" screamed out an old man
who was dancing with rage on the other side of the pailings.
"Get down. Can't you see that in a minute you'll bring the
whole place down? Get off at once."</p>

<p>But the boys merely gave him retort for curse. The bull
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
turned on to another baiter and dashed away. This boy
sprang into the branches of a young tree. The bull, going
full speed, hit the stern of the sapling with his forehead, and
the youth was shot off, describing a graceful parabola, and
landing with a thump on to the ground. Gradually the
game drifted to the other end of the plaza and we came down
from the fence.</p>

<div align="center">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Señora," said an anxious voice, "I have here a balcony.
It is quite respectable, for my wife is there. Pray do not
risk your life any longer."</p>

<p>The speaker was the husband of one of the Vinegar girls,
one of the nicest men we met in Jijona. He was short and
plump, and even as he spoke to me he gazed anxiously towards
the end of the plaza. While he was still urging me, the bull
made a movement in our direction, and he bolted. This
time we sought shelter in an open doorway, accompanied by
two priests. One lad tripped and the bull rolled him over
with its padded horns, but other lads ran up, one flapped a
handkerchief before the animal's nose, another hung on to
its tail. Somehow we could not help wondering what would
have happened to the bull had twenty public schoolboys
been loosed in that plaza!</p>

<p>At last the light faded. First the bull, then the boys
grew tired. The animal, captured with ropes, was led away
to become meat for future Jijona dinners&mdash;eating a playmate,
it seemed to me.</p>

<p>Further north in Spain they have a variant of this game.
A young bull is put into a wide circle formed of carts. The
bull's horns are not padded, and this game is quite dangerous.
A Polish painter, a friend of ours, once entered such a ring.
He was chased by the bull and to escape sprang for a
cart. He was not quite quick enough. With the upward
toss the bull thrust a horn through the seat of his trousers,
as the painter was in mid-air. Luckily the trousers were
an old pair, the seat came out wholesale and the painter
tumbled head first into the cart. He says that for the rest
of the day he went about with his hat clapped behind him.</p>

<p>The bull-baiting over, we called upon the doctor to whom
we carried an introduction from Luis. Then we scrambled
up to our Torre, taking with us provisions and candles. We
made up our mattress on the floor and slept the more soundly
for our hard bed.</p>

<p>We had one joy at Jijona&mdash;there were no mosquitoes,
and the nights were deliciously cool. Our windows were far
enough from the ground to allow the most timid of Spanish
women to sleep secure from robbers. The sun streaming in
at our windows awoke us before six&mdash;we dressed and breakfasted,
looking down on the town, which still lay in the
shadow. Immediately beneath our windows were two hundred
yards of stony hillside; then began the houses, small
and closely crowded as though they feared the rough arid
expanse of the towering hills of rock. We looked down
upon an almost Moorish succession of flat roofs, plunging
downhill into the valley. The surrounding country was like
a rough sea suddenly frozen, in front of us the mountains
seemed almost to curl over. A violet smoke was rising from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Jijona chimneys, a smoke which drifted a sweet scent to our
nostrils, a scent of sage and of fir. From the middle of the
village the church tower covered with blue and white tiles
suddenly chimed the hour with discordant bells.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vinegar was to take me the round of the shops.
She had previously tried to impress me with the dreadful
price of provisions in Jijona, and this time she prevented me
from buying eggs. The greengrocer's shop, kept by a gay
woman named Concha, was only an entrada filled with
baskets. Mrs. Vinegar had refused to change a note of
100 pesetas for me, and we discovered later that notes of any
magnitude greater than twenty-five pesetas are difficult to
change in villages. But Concha changed the money cheerfully
and earned my gratitude. Opposite Concha's shop,
frowning on the main street with grated windows, was the
prison, of which somebody said:</p>

<p>"Heavens! The Jijona men are so good that there
hasn't been a soul in the prison for the last five years. It is
full of chickens and rabbits."</p>

<p>We bought a frying-pan, having to choose between one
very small and one very large. The latter was thick in rust,
and must have been I don't know how many years on the
shelves of the shop. We chose it on condition that the shop man
could get it clean, and he at once put the whole of his
family to work on it, including a prospective daughter-in-law,
a French-African girl just arrived from Morocco. The customers
were whispering one to another, and at last one more
bold than the others addressed me:</p>

<p>"I saw you yesterday go down amongst the bulls. Were
you not terribly frightened? I thought that my heart was
going to stop."</p>

<p>We went to buy drinking glasses. The china shop was
deserted and we had to shout loudly before we could get
anybody to serve us. The woman did not know the price
of the glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"But no matter," she said, "you can pay any time you
like. And weren't you terribly frightened yesterday, going
down into the bulls? I couldn't draw my breath when I
saw you jump on to the wall."</p>

<p>There were children crowded at the shop door. As we
came out I heard murmurs, which gradually we made out as:</p>

<p>"La Valiente, La Valiente, La Valiente!"</p>

<p>I was known by this name during the whole of my stay
in Jijona.</p>

<p>On Sunday we dined at the Vinegars' and in the afternoon
the doctor took us to the Casino. I believe there is gambling
at these Casinos, but this takes place upstairs, and on the
ground floor they perform the function of the local club.
On Sunday afternoons and in the evenings the aristocracy
of the place collect here to sip ices while the local pianist
rattles off the latest music which has reached the town.</p>

<p>After supper we walked through the streets, feeling our
way up and down hill, for lights were few and the streets full
of rocks and unexpected steps. We heard the sound of
guitars and at once climbed towards it. At the top of a
staircase we came to a shop in front of which a family was
sitting. A woman with a rough voice began to chaff us.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she exclaimed, "you are the English of the
Torre de Blay. And the lady is the valiant one who is not
afraid of bulls. Ha ha! What? You are going to see the
dancing&mdash;well, let's all go."</p>

<p>The family heaved itself to its feet, surrounded and
escorted us down a narrow lane which ended at a platform
which hung on the cliff's edge. Three men were sitting on
the doorstep of a house, two playing guitars, one playing the
bandurria. A crowd, young men in blouses and girls, with
light skirts and shawls, were standing about or dancing.
Three couples were dancing a Valencian jota. Some of the
movements of the dance seemed intricate, but they danced
with a fine natural grace, and there was a beautiful balance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of body which echoed the movement of the music. A woman
standing behind me said:</p>

<p>"Now, Señora, I will teach you the jota one of these
evenings. And you will take my baby, because I have lots
and they say you have none."</p>

<p>Both on Saturday and on Sunday bull-baiting exhibitions
had taken place, but we had not gone to see them. One day
had been quite sufficient. On Monday morning we were
awakened by the sounds of music. The local band was
parading the streets playing a queer semi-Oriental music.
As the morning advanced other bands came in until seven
or eight bands were in full blast, each playing a different tune
and each trying to drown its rivals with sound. Gradually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Moors and Christians gathered. The Moors came from the
Near East and from the Far. The Chief and his immediate
suite were Bedouin Arabs, and there were Turks, Saracens,
Hindus, Chinamen, negroes and some of uncertain lineage.
Girls accompanied each group dressed in appropriate Houri
costume, carrying bottles filled with a liquor which would
have pleased Omar rather than Mahomet. The Christians
included Roman soldiers, crusaders, cavaliers and smugglers
of 1800. The latter were the chief Christian and his retinue.
Vivandières attended the Christians with drink no less
stimulating than that supplied to their Moorish enemies.
Moors and Christians carried large blunderbusses of ancient
mode, and all day long to the sounds of indefatigable melody
they paraded the town. It appeared to be the duty of the
Moors to be comic; they wore big goggles and many had huge
imitation beards with which, when the heat grew greater, they
fanned themselves. They pranced and postured through the
streets while the Christians marched along in solemn ranks.
Nor did the fiesta end with the going down of the sun. With
discreet intervals for refreshment, marching and music continued
till 2 a.m., at which time sleep and a blessed silence fell
on Jijona.</p>

<p>Undeterred by but four hours' rest, punctually at six the
cacophony of brass began again. By midday crusaders and
bandsmen, having exchanged helmets and caps, were dancing
jotas down the principal streets. But a short siesta revived
them for the principal work of the day: the entry of the
Moors. At about four in the afternoon the performers
gathered at the picturesque southern entrance of the village,
thus symbolizing the direction from which the Moors had
come. Then group by group, with blunderbusses banging off
into the air, the Christians retreated slowly up the street,
going backwards. Last of all the Christians went the Contrabandistas,
and last of the Contrabandistas the Captain,
dressed in a wonderful ancient costume of velvet, embroidered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with gold, silver and silk, and a blanket striped in many
colours. Facing him, advanced with equal solemnity and
noise the chief Moor. After some two hours of deafening
reports the whole troupe was in movement, some forwards,
others backwards, and had arrived at the wooden castle in
the plaza. By seven o'clock, at this funereal pace, the
Moors were at last massed before the castle.</p>

<p>"Now for the charge and for some fun," we thought.
But mounting a profusely decorated horse, the chief Moor
began a speech. The Contrabandista, evidently a man of
deeds only, had hired a real actor, dressed in the costume of a
cavalier, to represent him. For almost an hour exchange of
dramatic verse continued, after which the Christians quietly
walked out of the castle, and the Moors walked in.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," thought we, "is that all?"</p>

<p>With ears deafened from the guns we went home; passing
on the way a booth of green branches in which Moors and
Christians, overcome either by the heat or by the assiduous
ministrations of Houri or Vivandière, were laid out on sacks.</p>

<p>Though officially the day was ended, practically it was
not. Those who had private stocks of powder continued the
gunfire till midnight. The bands, their music becoming more
and more incoherent, played on till two o'clock.</p>

<p>We decided that we had seen enough fiesta. We stayed
in our castle and went out sketching in the country to avoid
the appalling din which rose from the town to our windows.
At night there was a modest display of fireworks in the plaza,
which we were quite content to enjoy from where we were.</p>

<p>After all was over they said to us:</p>

<p>"Wasn't it a beautiful fiesta?"</p>

<p>Outwardly we were forced to agree with them, but inwardly
we recognized&mdash;perhaps with a sense of regret&mdash;that
to enjoy these fiestas as they ought to be enjoyed, that is, as
a Spaniard enjoys them, requires a sense of values and perhaps
a nervous organism which we do not possess</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h4>JIJONA&mdash;TIA ROGER</h4>


<p>Jijona lived on almond paste. All around us the grey, pallid
or zebra striped mountains were terraced, and wherever
enough earth could be gathered together for an almond
tree to grow, there it was planted. The turron of Jijona, which
is made in perfection nowhere else, is a very popular sweet meat
all over Spain and even is widely appreciated in South
America. In Barcelona I have been greeted by turron-selling
youths who addressed me as La Valiente. On the French
frontier in a little village we found a turron-stall kept by a
man in Jijona costume of black blouse and pointed hat; but
he was a fraud: he had never been near Jijona, nor could he
speak the Jijona dialect. But the whole life of Jijona was
dominated by turron marzipan, and the varieties of sweet meats
made from almonds. We arrived as the almonds were
beginning to ripen. Out on the mountains one heard the
thrashing of the canes amongst the branches as the peasants
beat the nuts off the almond trees. From the village rose up
a sound like that of a gigantic typewriter as the women of
the village sat in the streets in circles and cracked the almond
shells. In our entrada old Père Chicot crouched most of the
day on his haunches, peeling, drying and cracking the almonds
from El Señor's garden.</p>

<p>In consequence of the turron work we found it very
difficult to get a woman to work for us. Life became difficult.
The conditions in Jijona were not the same as those in
Verdolay. In the latter place we could buy excellent
charcoal, but to our surprise we found charcoal difficult to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
get in Jijona. When we did get it, from the proprietor of
the local cinematograph theatre, it was so hard that it would
not burn. Père Chicot said gruffly, "What are almond
shells for?" We then tried burning almond shells; but
they made a poor fire, and an accumulation of shells soon put
itself out. We wasted one and a half hours trying to fry
potatoes on an almond-shell fire. So as long as we could not
get a woman, we had to live on cold stuff that we could buy
from the shops: Dutch cheese, and sardines, principally.</p>

<p>At last I thought that I had found a woman. I was
perched on the watercourse which ran across the face of the
precipice opposite the entrance of the town. From this spot
there was an excellent view of Jijona in its most romantic,
but also in its most plastic aspect. To me came a woman
walking along the edge of the watercourse, balancing on her
head a large washing-basket. She stopped to watch my work,
and as was the custom in those early days began to talk about
the bull episode.</p>

<p>"Ah, that was a terrible thing to do," she said. "If I had
gone down into the plaza, my knees would have turned to
water."</p>

<p>I then asked her how I could get somebody to work for
me.</p>

<p>"Why," she answered, "I'll come myself, or send somebody
else."</p>

<p>She then began to move along her way. The wall of the
watercourse was about a foot wide; but ten yards further
along it ceased to curve around the face of the precipice and
sprang across a chasm over a narrow bridge. The approach
to this bridge was guarded by a large polished boulder about
three feet high, and to get on to the bridge one had to clamber
over this boulder. I had crossed it on hands and knees
cautiously, for there was a sheer drop of forty or fifty feet
below. The woman looked at this boulder and turning said
to me:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a nasty spot. I'll have to be careful there, or
I'll drop my washing."</p>

<p>With the basket on her head she walked to the boulder
and began to walk up its slippery side. Balancing herself
and basket in what appeared a dangerous manner, giving little
cries of "Aie! Aie! I'm afraid I'll drop my basket," she
surmounted the obstacle and strode carelessly across the
bridge. My heart left my throat to regain its normal position
and I realized that there is even a fashion in "fear."</p>

<p>But the woman never came, and for a week we were
servantless. The pretty girl who had driven out with us in
the lorry, and who we had imagined to be the daughter of a
fairly well-to-do farmer, was as a matter of fact our nearest
neighbour. She lived at the top house of the town. Her
father was the village dust-cart, and any day could be seen
walking about the streets bent almost double beneath the
weight of a huge pannier which he carried on his back, into
which he flung any object which had no permanent right on
the high road. Her house was a small affair of two rooms
only. We put our difficulty to her as she was friendly, and
to our surprise she said that she would come and do it herself.
She did arrange that the goat with his milk should call upon
us; but the Vinegars enticed her into their turron factory,
and again we were in despair. However, the girl had an idea.</p>

<p>"Why, Mother will do it for you," she said.</p>

<p>Mother was an apt-looking spouse for the dust-cart, and
was considered, we heard, the dirtiest woman in the village.
Her foggy blue eyes showed white all round them, and she
threw up her lips like a biting horse when she spoke Castilian
(which she did very badly). I don't know why she made me
think of the Red queen in Alice, but her silhouette was not
unlike, and she had a queer trick of being in the house one
instant, and in the next of having quite vanished&mdash;which was
Red-queenlike. She was called "Aunt Roger" in the village,
because of her ruddy hair. Aunt Roger cleared up the mystery
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
of the Jijona fuel. She made bargains with boys, who wandered
out over the hills, and returned looking like walking haycocks
under a load of branches of mountain pine and other
coniferous shrub. From then on we cooked over large bonfires
built on the square hearth which was in our largest room.</p>

<p>Tia Roger was elusive in small matters, as she was in larger
ones. She had a hasty Spanish way of agreeing at once to
save herself the trouble of understanding my language, and
we never knew whether she would come or no. She drew our
pay without demur, but if an occasion offered for other
employment she took it. We would return home at eleven
o'clock worn out with a hard day's painting, to find the place
uncleaned, no fire alight, no food either bought or prepared.
This would entail on our part a rush down the steep hill into
the town, to search for food. Probably on the way we would
discover Tia Roger sitting amongst a circle of gossiping and
pleased women, industriously cracking almonds. She would
show no signs of conscious sin, but would grin and nod at us
as we passed. Then we had to scramble again up to our eyrie
under the full heat of the Mediterranean sun.</p>

<p>Tia Roger had many children. Her eldest daughter was
married to a man who for some time puzzled us. We first
saw him wandering about the upper streets of the old town
during the fiesta. He carried an elaborate pair of sandwich
boards. On the front was the well-known picture, "St.
Veronica's Handkerchief," and on the back an oleograph
representing two conventional angels&mdash;golden hair, nightdress,
and wings. Both pictures were surrounded by flat wooden
frames fretworked in the hideous art-nouveau manner. He
wandered about thus, enclosed, as it were a slab of humanity
between two slices of divinity; but we could not imagine
what his purpose was. We imagined that he filled a semi-religious
post, something connected with the priests, and
their fiesta, and their cinema, and bull chasings. But on
the fourth day of the fiesta, this wandering, apparently
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
purposeless man tripped over a washing-basket. His language
at once put to flight all our ideas of his religious functions,
it issued straight from a nature by no means purged of old
Adam, despite its devotional enclosure. Later, he fell over
me as I was sketching, and he cursed me with gusto. I then
saw he was blind. This had not been apparent to us earlier,
for he took the rough and precipitous streets of Jijona at an
extraordinary speed.</p>

<p>One day we saw him still wandering to and fro, but the
pictures had disappeared. A cage was on his back, and in
the cage, balancing against the joggle and movement of his
walk, was an uncomfortable hen. We had become more
accustomed to the Jijona speech by this time, and the tickets
which the pictures had hidden were plainly visible in his hands.
He was running a private lottery at three chances "a little
bitch." I took thirty tickets for the hen, and gave fifteen
of them to Tia Roger, but we pulled blanks. His next venture
was a bedroom looking-glass, the stand of which stuck out
from his back in an ungainly fashion. It must have needed
considerable ingenuity to keep his small village clientèle
sufficiently desirous to ensure for him any sort of a living.</p>

<p>His wife learned that I had put him into one of my
sketches. She hurried to the Torre de Blay, carrying her child,
and accompanied by a horde of women friends to see "The
Portrait." Her disappointment was great to find that he
was but a minute figure in a street landscape. She told me
that her husband had lost his sight ten years before in a street
quarrel. His opponent had slashed a knife across his eyes.
For this the law exacted no penalty. But she had drawn no
lesson from her husband's misfortune. Her baby was in a
bad condition, flies, dust and exposure to the sun were working
wickedly on the child's eyes, and even then early blindness
appeared to be threatening. But it seemed to us that many
of the more ignorant Spanish were careless of their children's
eyesight. Blindness is rampant, but blindness leads to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
beggary; and beggary accompanied by blindness is a profitable
pursuit. Possibly a woman may say, "Little Juan seems
to be going blind. Well, that's a comfort, he will be settled
in life anyhow."</p>

<p>Jijona had two other blind men. The one made a living
by selling cigars from a glass case strapped to his chest.</p>

<p>We were sitting in the entrada of the Vinegars' on the first
day of the fiesta. The curtain was pushed slowly aside and
through the opening crept a pathetic figure. It was that of
an old man; his eyes were sightless and suppurating, a straw
hat with a torn brim shaded his heavy face, in one hand he
grasped an aged guitar, in the other a stick with which he
explored the entrada for a chair. Jan quickly got out of his
chair for fear that the blind man should sit down on his lap.
The man found the chair with his stick, and trembling with
the pain of movement took a seat. Adjusting the guitar,
with stiff fingers he rasped the strings which gave out a sound,
thin as though withered by extreme age. With exercise his
fingers strengthened, until from the decrepit instrument he
plucked a melody from which one might imagine that the
blind in Maeterlinck's play were dancing to solace their
loneliness. The almost macabre dance came to an end, then
striking out a new set of chords he broke into a Spanish song.
His voice was an instrument as worn out as the guitar.</p>

<p>He ceased his heartrending performance, collected his
meed of halfpence; I spoke to him, and he broke into an
hysterical laugh of joy.</p>

<p>"You have returned, you have returned," he cried.</p>

<p>"It is El Señor that he takes you for," explained one of
the girls. "He was very good to him. The old man recognizes
the English accent."</p>

<p>We explained to him his mistake, and the delight faded
from his poor old face, and the blank expressionless look of
the blind came back. Slowly he turned to the entrance and
his tapping, which led him away down the street. Thus he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
pursued his trade, feeling his way from door to door, entering
any one that was open, seating himself upon the first unoccupied
chair which he could find: few could have been
hard-hearted enough to deny his unspoken pleading.</p>

<p>One evening we met him in the upper town.... An
accident had happened, and his guitar was opened out like an
old boot; it still held together at the handle, but at the front
of the instrument the soundboard and back had become
detached from the sides. In a clumsy fashion the hurt had
been bound up with string. We asked him what had happened.
He did not reply, but cried out with a high-pitched, half-crazy
laugh. Then standing astraddle in the precipitous street
he began to pluck at the strings as though the guitar could
answer for him. The thin voice of it had now sunk to a mere
ghost of a sound, the murmur of a summer freshet might well
have drowned its plaintive whisper. Then turning he made
his way downhill</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

<h4>JIJONA&mdash;A DAY'S WORK</h4>


<p>It was a toss-up which would arrive first: the sun shooting
its long level rays over the mountain-top through our
windows, or Tia Roger's daughter hammering on the
door with the milk, warm and frothy, in a jug. Either the
one or the other aroused us from our mattress on the floor&mdash;for
we had dispensed quite comfortably with the complications
of a bed. Possibly our night had been restless, for inadvertently
I had imported a host of fleas into the house. They had
come from the garden, from a small spot near an outhouse
door, where there was a fascinating view, and I had stood
there one morning with bare legs and feet admiring the scene.
When I had returned to the house, I had noticed a strange
blackish discoloration on my ankles, and stooping had discovered
to my horror that hordes of hungry fleas were crawling
up my legs. I had jumped into a basin of water, but many
had escaped. From that moment the house was never clear
of them, and our nights were sometimes disturbed. We
suspect that Père Chicot kept his rabbit skins in the outhouse.</p>

<p>We got out of bed either at the call of the sun or of the
milk; and as we were dressing we watched the purple and
green mists of night clearing off the valley and from the town
below us. Breakfast was a simple affair&mdash;tea and dry bread
and grapes. Spanish coffee is expensive and bad, cocoa we
did not find, and butter and jam were unprocurable. For
the boiling water we could not go to the trouble of building
a bonfire, so in spite of the expense of spirit we used a methylated
spirit stove. This Jan had bought in Murcia. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
shopman had ill understood Jan's attempts to make his needs
known. "Lampara para alcool"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> had elicited no response,
but at last, driven by repeated requests with variations,
explanations, hand wavings, and so on, intelligence had
brightened the shopman's face.</p>

<p>"Ah, Señor," he had cried, "I understand you now.
What you require is a 'little hell.'"</p>

<p>So the kettle sang daily over "little hell," but this morning,
Tia Roger having forgotten to purchase alcohol overnight,
it looked as if we were to breakfast on goat's milk
alone. But an idea occurred to me. El Señor, when he had
transferred his major residence to Murcia, had left some
furniture and much litter in El Torre de Blay. Amongst
the litter were odd bottles which had contained toilet lotions,
one was half full. Was there not a chance then that it was
alcoholic? I routed out the bottle. The smell told me nothing.
Practical experiment was the only thing. Imagination was
rewarded. "Little hell" worked as well on hair-wash as with
any other fuel.</p>

<p>We ate our simple breakfast at an ancient refectory
table, the top hewn from the width of a large tree, the legs
curved and carved like those in Viking pictures. Then we set
to packing up paint and brushes, and the preparing of sketch boxes.
Leaving the things untidy for Tia Roger to clear,
we set off on our respective ways, I down into the old town,
Jan out across the mountains. Jijona was a maze of zigzag
streets. In the morning it was almost manless, but women
went to and fro on their household errands, and the children
followed me in swarms. Standing about in the streets were
small coops, enclosing either a chicken or a turkey, while the
queer lean Egyptian cats, with rat-like tails, slunk along the
walls, vanishing like ghosts at any attempt to stroke them.
Even the kittens of a few days old spat at a proffered pat
as though at a dog. I was bound for the street near the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
monastery which, with its blue-tiled roof, brought the eastern
end of Jijona to a full stop.</p>

<p>As soon as I had settled down the questions began. They
were the usual Spanish questions such as one had heard in
Verdolay, and many of the answers I knew now by heart.
But one woman behind me said something new.</p>

<p>"It is an English Señora. She is painting. All the
English people paint, for there have been other English here&mdash;El
Señor, and his friends&mdash;and they, too, painted. It is
strange, indeed, that a whole nation should be thus gifted.
Also all the English are very rich, for they come here from a
long distance, and they paint pictures, and all that is very
expensive. Another thing that I can tell you about the
English is that they are all very tall. Every Englishman that
I have seen (she had seen four) is much taller than we Spanish
are. It does not matter that I am saying this out loud because
La Doña does not understand Valenciano."</p>

<p>While I was working this morning there was a continual
sound of squealing pigs. Men's voices mingled with those of
the pigs, urging them to be quiet. The sound came from a
high-walled enclosure to which the entrance was an archway
closed by a massive wooden door. Then along came a goat herd
leading his flock. But as soon as the herd came opposite
to this door it refused to pass it. With shouts, curses, and
stones the man urged the goats along. In little quick rushes,
thus urged on, one by one the goats dashed past the door
and on down the road. But two refused the passage perilous.
They made sneezing noises of protestation, but nothing would
induce them to move. In despair the man at last had to
bring all his goats back and take them to the hills by some
other route. Later I realized that the door which these
intelligent animals would not pass was the slaughter-house.</p>

<p>Old men, dressed in the ancient Jijona costume of black
blouse and black velvet hat with turned-up brim and pointed
crown&mdash;kept on to the head by an elastic at the back&mdash;would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
address me in a patois impossible to understand. As the
sketch neared completion my audience became excited.</p>

<p>"Ha Pintado tod'! tod'! tod'!"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> they exclaimed. They
searched the picture for the smaller details, the strings of red
peppers hanging from the balconies especially delighted them.
Indeed, they gave my pictures titles because of some minute
detail.</p>

<p>"What is she doing?" a new-comer exclaimed. The
answer was "The fig tree." I was astonished, because I could
see no fig tree in the whole sketch. At last one of my audience
pointed to one tiny branch of green projecting over a wall.</p>

<p>Jan had four directions to choose from. North and south
led him across a flattish plain seamed with deep watercourses,
east and west took him into the mountains. To the east
the mountains were grey bare stone, almost uncultivated;
to the west the mountains went steeper and steeper, ending
in a high ridge, at the foot of which was a queer leprous country,
the earth spotted all over with lichens and looking as though
mouldy. Wherever he went were the terraces and almond
trees; and lonely little farms were perched high up on the
slopes. Terrible little places those farms were for the doctor,
for, if any one were ill in them, there was often no means of
approach other than miles of climbing on foot. But all
across the mountains, incongruous enough in that landscape
of primitive agriculture where the plough was but a stake with
an iron spike, and where no roads were, went standards
carrying wires of electricity. On the standards, deaths'-heads
were painted to scare off the inquisitive child.</p>

<p>Jan had not only to contend with sun and flies. Shadow
was even more difficult to find at Jijona than at Verdolay;
the almond as a shade tree is negligible. It was hot setting
out, but it was hotter coming back. One did not delay much
after half-past ten, but, whether the sketch were finished or
no, one packed up one's things and set off homeward. As one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
walked one could feel the heat of the ground through the soles
of the alpagatas. There were reputed to be scorpions in the
mountains, and it was as well to be careful when taking a seat
or when picking up some painting implement dropped to the
ground. But Jan never saw one. The peasants said that
if he were stung the best thing to do was to plunge the stung
part&mdash;usually a finger&mdash;into a raw egg; when the yolk had
turned black, a fresh egg was to be substituted.</p>

<p>We were both back in good time on this day, because we
were to lunch with the doctor and his wife. They had promised
us a truly Spanish meal. Here is the menu:</p>

<p>1. Smoked uncooked ham.</p>

<p>2. Hors d'œuvre, olives (cured in anis and mint), pink
tomatoes (a Jijona speciality), cucumber, and orange-coloured
sausage.</p>

<p>3. Soup.</p>

<p>4. A stew of chicken, potatoes and garbanzos. (Garbanzos,
or chick-peas, look something like dried nasturtium seeds.
They are cooked like haricot beans, and taste like a blend of
haricot bean and lentil. They are a very favourite Spanish
vegetable.)</p>

<p>5. Cold fish and mayonnaise. (The mayonnaise was made
from almond oil, lemon juice and hard-boiled egg, and was
extremely delicate in flavour.)</p>

<p>6. Fried ham and grilled tomatoes.</p>

<p>7. Turron and almond paste sweets.</p>

<p>8. Yellow melon and muscatel grapes. Brandy.</p>

<p>9. Iced coffee (brought in by a boy from the Casino).</p>

<p>The doctor's wife asked me if it were true that English
people did not like questions. I said personally we did not
mind questions, but that in England direct intimate questions
were generally avoided.</p>

<p>"But," said the doctor's wife in amazement, "if you wish
to find out something about anybody, how do you do so? And
how do you carry on conversations?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The meal over, we toiled slowly up again to El Torre, taking
the hill in as leisurely a manner as we could. Tia Roger's
daughter was sitting on our doorstep eating grapes. As we
passed she held the bunch out to us.</p>

<p>"Les Gusta?"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> she said.</p>

<p>"Buen aproveche," we replied.</p>

<p>Before their gateway, the two aged men and the one old
woman sat, as they did from morning till night, plaiting
an everlasting rope of esparto grass.</p>

<p>We had acquired the siesta habit, so lay down until four
o'clock. Then, as the dinner had rather disorganized our
desire to paint, Jan and I went for a walk. We clambered
down through the town, passed out by the southern entrance,
across the bridge, and clambered up the hill opposite. At a
long open washing-place, women were on their knees beating
and scrubbing clothes with the Spanish soap which will not
lather; amongst them, working as hard as the rest, was a child
of five years old.</p>

<p>We skirted the line between the mountains, and the flat
and plain for about two miles, then Jan took a path leading
away from the mountains. We came out into the most
fantastic scenery of its kind I have ever seen. In the winter
the torrential rains burst on the mountains and the water
rushing down had scooped deep clefts in the earth of the plain.
The ground itself appeared to be in layers of various colours,
and these layers falling in one above the other had striped
the sides of the deep canyon purple, blue, white, orange and
red. The water had cut out of the clayey earth a hundred
fantastic shapes&mdash;I have seen photographs of the Grand
Canyon of Colorado, this was like them on a small scale; at
one place the clay was harder and the water dripping down had
carved the cliff-side like great organ pipes or like the columns
of an Egyptian temple. In the deep bottoms of the canyon
were vine terraces; and further down flat, irrigated fields of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
tomatoes, of herbage or of vegetables. Little farm-houses
sheltered under the mud cliffs, and on the circular threshing floors
almonds and red peppers were spread out to dry in the
sun. In one place a man had scooped his dwelling out of the
cliff-side. These cave dwellings are common enough. At
Verdolay was a whole colony of them, and the cavemen were
reputed to be thieves and vagabonds, and the members were
despised by the peasants proper. At the end of the ravine
or barranca we came to a many-arched bridge which towered
high above our heads, and clambering up by a zigzag track
found ourselves on the Alicante road.</p>

<p>In appearance this country is very deceptive. It appears
arid, almost desolate, but the mountains are covered with
almond trees, which for all their scanty foliage bear valuable
crops, while the plain hides its richness in ravines a hundred
feet or more below the level of its surface.</p>

<p>We arrived home to find a stranger dressed in black clothes,
but with an official cap on his head, sitting on a stone seat
before our door. He was reading a book, and as we came up
he bowed and said that he hoped his presence was not distasteful
to us. We, of course, in the fashion of Spanish
courtesy, put our whole home at his disposal, and invited him
indoors. He demurred in the correct fashion, but on a
second invitation came in with us. In the long entrada Père
Chicot was looking out through the back door and shaking
his head at the garden.</p>

<p>"There's another tree dying," he said. "All the trees
are dying, and the vines won't bear. You can't do anything
without water."</p>

<p>"But is there no water at all?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Ay," replied Père Chicot, "there used to be the right
to two hours of water once a fortnight. But the owners sold
it. They wanted money and it was worth many hundreds
of pesetas."</p>

<p>Our visitor was very interested in the house, for he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
confided in us that there was a housing shortage in Jijona,
like that in the rest of the world. He was chief of the municipal
officers, dust-cart, water-supply, electric light and so on.
He had just come from Toledo, and the only place he could
find in Jijona was not nearly large enough for his family.</p>

<p>"This would just suit me," he said, peering into room
after room, "seven rooms; and they say that St. Sebastian
used to live here. Did you know that?"</p>

<p>His eye was attracted by the guitar of El Señor, which we
had brought with us.</p>

<p>"And you an afficionado of the guitar," he exclaimed.
"I, too, have played in my time."</p>

<p>We pressed him to play.</p>

<p>"No, no; indeed I would like to, but I may not. You
see, my wife's father died a week ago, and it would seem very
wicked if I were to play, or to sing."</p>

<p>Jan played him a farouka which he had learned from
Blas.</p>

<p>"It seems a good guitar," said the man.</p>

<p>He picked it up, and fingered the chords. Then he went
to the door and peered round it to see if Père Chicot had gone
home.</p>

<p>"I might sing you something if you won't tell any one,"
said the chief of the municipal officers. "But I will sing it
in a very low voice, so that it will be less disrespectful to my
wife's father."</p>

<p>He sang, in a hoarse unmusical whisper, a guajiras.</p>

<p>"I like the guajiras and also the tango," said he. "You
see, I did my military duty in Cuba, and I learned many over
there."</p>

<p>Here are three of the songs he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will never marry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as a bachelor I am gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have money to spend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I live like a general all day.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></div></div>

</div></div>

<p>As he went on he began to forget his father-in-law, and in
a short while he was bawling indecent tangos at the top of his
voice. He showed no signs of departure, so I began to prepare
for supper. I lit the bonfire which Tia Roger had laid in the
wide hearth-place, placed over it a three-legged trivet of iron
and on the trivet our huge saucepan full to the brim with
olive oil. We then made use of a Spanish custom. We asked
him to supper with us. This he was forced by Spanish custom
to refuse, and as we did not repeat the invitation he had to
make his compliments&mdash;which he did with the greatest
courtesy&mdash;and go home.</p>

<p>After supper, as our bread supply was short, we felt our
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
way down the hill in the dark and down the staircases of
streets to the shop of Manuel Garcia. Garcia and his wife
sold bread at one fat dog cheaper than the other shops. The
bread was quite as good as any other, it had a very white
powdery kind of consistency, baked in flat loaves with a very
hard, anæmic crust. The Garcias had showed us one of the
economical devices which were in current use. We had for
some days bought candles at this shop, but Mrs. Garcia
said:</p>

<p>"Why do you spend all this money on candles? Here
is a thing much better, and much cheaper. You first pour
water into a cup or bowl until half-way up, then fill to the top
with olive oil. Float one of these on the top of the oil, and
set fire to it. There you have a light at half the cost of
candles."</p>

<p>The box she handed to us was full of pieces of cork through
which a wick had been thrust. On the top of the box was the
name of the device "little-lamps-little-boats" and a picture
of the Virgin. We stepped back in our illumination to the
most ancient of methods&mdash;the old Roman conquerors of Spain
must have illuminated their villas in this way. "Little-lamps-little-boats"
had probably given light to the halls of
the Saracen castle which now was but a few crumbling masses
of slowly disintegrating cement. It was curious to think
that one-half of Jijona was lit by electric light, the other by
this antique device, and that there was practically nothing
between. Mrs. Garcia had urged us to the stewing of
garbanzos.</p>

<p>The Garcias were go-ahead Spaniards. Starting from very
small origins, they had begun a small turron factory in a back
room. Not content with making turron alone, they had
peddled it all over the Balearic Isles. Gradually they had
prospered, and the whole upper part of the house was now
factory, the entrance to the factory being higher up the hill
in a back street. Yet they remained simple people, sitting,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
in the evenings, on their doorstep gossiping, while the flaxen-haired
daughter, sixteen years old, painted with a toothpick
dipped in dye eyes and noses on sugar pigs and cats.</p>

<p>"We had a hard time at first," said Mrs. Garcia. "In
Majorca the people were very jealous of us, and often very
rude. They would tell us to go back to our own district;
they used to laugh at our speech, though God knows they
can't speak proper Spanish themselves."</p>

<p>This inter-district jealousy seems characteristic of Spain.
The man from Toledo laughed at the Jijona people; the people
of Jijona called those of Murcia "gipsies"; the people of
Murcia say that the Jijona folk are mere uncultivated
mountaineers; Catalan and Castilian are in semi-enmity.
Each person that one spoke to lauded the beauties and the
food of his own district at the expense of other places. All
about Jijona they would have nothing but malegueñas and
Valencian jotas. The other varieties of Spanish music they
were not interested in.</p>

<p>But the Garcias were progressive people. They had made
a success of their Balearic venture, and now had a stall in
the market of Alicante. This was kept by a sister-in-law.
Garcia and his wife were making preparations to go to the great
fair at Albacete. The shop was full of large bales done up in
straw matting, boxes and crates of sweets and of turron.
They would go by road, for it was cheaper, and only about a
hundred miles away.</p>

<p>"That is a queer town," said Garcia. "There are gates
to the walls, and at a certain hour they shut the gates, and
if you are outside you stay outside till the morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Garcia wanted me to paint her portrait. If she would
have posed to me in the ordinary, peasant, workaday dress
I would have done it with pleasure. But she had a fine
fashionable modern silk dress of black and she wanted to pose
in this. I managed to put off the proposal until the time of
her departure was too close. She went away unsatisfied</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<h4>JIJONA&mdash;THE GOATHERDS</h4>


<p>Murcia could be counted as unmusical, in Verdolay one
heard either a gramophone of the little Señor, or the
piano banged by the girls who lived in the topmost
house of the village. In Jijona, on the contrary, almost
every evening could be heard the sound of the guitar or of
that strange Eastern singing of Spain. Young men sat on
the edge of the cliff below the Saracen castle and thumped
two or three chords from a guitar for half the night long. It
had a delight, analogous to that which the tom-tom gives, a
delight drawn from the hypnotism of inexorable rhythm.
But save for the commandant of the municipal officers, who
was a stranger, we had made the acquaintance of none of
the musicians until one afternoon the goatherds perched
themselves in the shadow beneath our walls.</p>

<p>We were taking a siesta when the sound of thrumming
roused us from the half sleep which the afternoon gives.
Jan exclaimed:</p>

<p>"That music sounds quite near."</p>

<p>He jumped up and looked out of the window. On a
narrow ledge of flat rock at the foot of the wall three men
were sitting in the shadow of the house. Two had guitars,
and all along the wall of the garden a number of goats were
lying down or were browsing on the small weeds which
sprouted between the rocks. On the hill-side the kids were
engaging one another in mock battle, rearing up in feint,
with the most dainty of gestures, or interlocking their infantile
horns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>We slipped on our clothes, and crawling out by the garden
door, the opening of which was only about four feet high, we
joined the goatherds in their patch of shadow.</p>

<p>"Buenos dias," said Jan. "I, too, love the guitar."</p>

<p>"Si, Señor," answered one of the herds, "through the
windows we have heard you playing."</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i219.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>One of the men was thin but wore an enormous pagoda-like
sombrero of straw, one was a boy of eighteen with a
huge moustache, the third was an old man with a large nose,
the wrinkles on his face drawn more deeply than any we
have before seen. Their guitars were poor instruments and
the strings were broken and knotted together, in consequence
of which little bits of stick were tied across the arm of the
instrument in order to clamp the strings down to the fingerboard
below the knotted parts. As the strings break and are
repaired, this stick is moved up the fingerboard until the
strings are too short to play upon. Jan crawled through the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
small door and brought out the big white guitar. The thin
man handled it with reverence.</p>

<p>"I know the instrument," he said. "It is El Señor's.
It is a good instrument, but he has a better. A big brown
one which is a marvel. He must be very rich. They say he
gave more than two hundred pesetas for it."</p>

<p>He played on it for a moment, but soon handed it back
to Jan.</p>

<p>"I'd rather play on my old one," he said. "I'm not
afraid of it, and I can knock it about as I like."</p>

<p>All three were dressed in cotton shirts and pants, tied at
the ankle with tape, over these they wore cotton coats and
trousers; when the weather was very hot they dispensed
with the trousers. Their feet were bare of stocking, but
their shoes were heavy; woven by themselves out of esparto
grass, very Oriental in shape with turned-up, pointed toes.
On their backs were sacks containing esparto grass and half-fashioned
sandals. Each possessed a long, heavy, crook'd
stick shod with an iron point.</p>

<p>All too soon they said that they must be moving on.
"But come down to the street of the soap house, top side,
this evening, and we'll have a dance and singing."</p>

<p>I had sketched in this street. It was on the steepest part
of the hill and ran almost horizontally across, so that the
front door of the upper houses were on a level with the roofs
of the lower ones. The roadway was divided along the centre,
one-half being some twenty feet above the other; a low
parapet protected the drop. It was lucky that the dwellers
in the upper part of the street were sober Spaniards.</p>

<p>We found, as usual, the party seated on chairs in the
middle of the street, near a small electric light; some of the
men were sitting along the parapet. We were greeted by an
old, but very large woman who groaned all the evening with
rheumatism. The girls were in their best dresses of pale
coloured skirt and embroidered paisley patterned shawls. A
long silence followed our arrival. We were waiting for a
player who was the best in the village. He could not come,
but sent his brother instead, who played well, but was
left-handed. Three guitars and a guitarron formed the
orchestra.</p>

<p>Thrum, thrum, thrum, went the guitars, while across the
deeper chords the little guitarron, with its strange tuning,
threaded a shrill pattern of monotonous arpeggios. The music
of Spain has something fundamental about it. It has a hint of
the heart-beat of the universe. The rich, pulsating rhythm
of it seems to set the air flowing in waves like those in a
disturbed pool. It seems to speak of something ideally simple,
to create an harmonious forgetfulness. A girl sitting amongst
us threw back her head and sang. Her voice carried the sad
minor cadences of the eternal East; it was pitched queerly
in the throat and wailed across the still night like the voice
of a passionate soul.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When I am dead a hundred years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the worms have eaten me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Will show that I have worshipped thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am dead a hundred years."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song began with a long-drawn-out aie-e-e, which ran a
gamut of strange, almost creepy modulations, the guitars
slowed down their tempo, but when the last echo of the song
had died amongst the hills, the instruments took up once
more the remorseless beat of the malagueña.</p>

<p>Again she sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Aie-e-e...."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Once more she sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Your eyes like double evils are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black as is the dark of Hades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you have to cover them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ebon thickets of your lashes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your eyes like double evils are."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The guitars beat up the rhythm once more and then a man
began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In your eyes there is a sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your mouth with heaven itself can vie,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In your eyes there is a sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again he sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The only love which I discovered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like black gunpowder reacted;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, explosion, light; then after ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Followed ashes, silence, darkness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only love which I discovered."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By this time a large number of men and of girls had
gathered.</p>

<p>"Vamos!" they cried. "Let's have a jota. Come on,
Perico, play something that we can dance to."</p>

<p>The guitar-players changed their tempo, the little guitarron
beat out with a more insistent though more flexible rhythm.
The jota has a beat which is partly the beat of the bar,
partly that of the phrase. This is common in Spanish music
and has points of resemblance with early European music
generally.</p>

<p>Three girls and three of the youths lined up face to face,
and soon the dancers were swinging to and fro over the
uneven roadway. There is an agile grace in the jota. We
watched it with delighted eyes. But the old rheumatic woman
did not look pleased.</p>

<div align="center">

<p>"That girl," she muttered to me, nodding her head at
one of the dancers, "she has no right to dance. She is
apunto. You know," she went on, noting my perplexed
expression, "she is expecting a baby soon. It is very wrong
of her to dance."</p>

<p>The dancers moved with flexible rhythm, snapping their
fingers with the music, and their shadows, flung on the wall
by the dim electric light, caricatured their movements. The
guitars beat on, creating an atmosphere of careless joy which
seemed to bring us into more sensitive contact with the
Spaniards than ever we had been before. We wonder
if civilization has anything to give to these people. They
live simple, straightforward and pleasant lives, tempered, it
is true, by sickness and pain and sometimes by privation;
but it would be a rash man who would promise to give them
greater store of valuable things than they already have.
The fact that most cannot read does not hamper them very
much. They have wisdom stored up in a thousand witty
proverbs, and for their leisure they have the guitar and their
songs.</p>

<p>What a wonderful instrument the guitar is! The simplest
of all instruments for the learner, a few days' practice makes
him so that he can play as do the generality of these herdsmen.
Then one can hypnotize oneself with the sonorous rhythm of
repeated chords. But if one wishes to go further, the range
and variety of the guitar is inexhaustible. It has as many
moods as nature and is as difficult to conquer. Sarasate,
they say, gave up the guitar because it was so difficult. But
the guitar in the hands of the master is the finest of all
instruments. Of single portable instruments it alone is complete;
it alone is fully satisfying. We English do not know
the guitar. Outside of Spain it has never been played. And
the Spanish music made for the guitar ... like life itself
with its interwoven themes of sadness and of joy; with
mournful melody accompanied by strange gay accompaniment,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the words often in strange contrast with the melodic theme.
There is no native music in Europe which has the range, the
variety, and the depth of feeling possessed by that of Spain.</p>

<p>We tore ourselves away while yet they were dancing; for
we remembered that 5.30 was our rising time. The thin
goatherd, who wore the enormous hat in the daytime, took
us into his house and gave us a drink. The baby was in its
cradle, its face carefully tucked under the sheet. The
aguadiente which he poured out for us was strong and harsh
to the taste; and one was grateful for the glass of water
which it is customary to drink afterwards.</p>

<p>As we were getting ready for bed, we could still hear the
sounds of the guitars and the cries of the dancers on the calm
air of the night.</p>

<p>The goatherds used to come almost every afternoon to
the foot of our castle, and we gave up the siesta habit in
their favour.</p>

<p>I made the acquaintance of one other goatherd in Jijona.
I was painting in a street near the Garcias' shop. When the
picture was nearly complete, I wished for a figure and asked
an old man to pose for me. He was nearing eighty, and his
face was a map of wrinkles, with a mountain of nose and
chin and a valley of toothless mouth. His clothes were a
patchwork of different materials. The study which I made
of him delighted him so much that he begged for it. He
would pay me, he said.</p>

<p>"The price does not matter," he exclaimed, "if only La
Doña will put in a goat also." For he owned the flock which
he led every day into the mountains.</p>

<p>I made him a copy of it, and all the other goatherds
trooped up to the castle to see Tio Pepe's portrait.</p>

<p>"Ay, there's Pepe," they cried, slapping their thighs;
"there he is with his patches, and his crook'd stick, and his
sandals and his old nose and all. Tod', Tod'."</p>

<p>It was near the time of our departure from Jijona. Tio
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Pepe in vain tried to press on me a few pesetas for the portrait.
He searched his old mind for a means of showing his gratitude;
and just as we were leaving he found a solution. At five
o'clock in the morning, as our trunk was leaving the house
on the shoulders of Tia Roger's strong young son, up ran
Uncle Pepe with a large can of goat's milk, all of which we
had to drink on the spot; or he would never have forgiven us.</p>

<p>The night before our departure we had packed, for we
had to start early to catch the motor-bus. Then we had
gone to bed. We had just snuggled down beneath the
blankets, for the nights were getting quite fresh, when I
heard the sounds of a guitar. The sounds drew closer. They
were coming up the hill. A suspicion grew to a certainty.</p>

<p>"Jan," I cried, "those goatherds are giving us a farewell
serenade."</p>

<p>We hurried into our clothes. The goatherds had sat
themselves down on the stone bench at the front door and
were singing lustily at the moon. I don't know what the
Spanish etiquette in such matters is, but we went out and
took part in our own serenade. It was a lengthy affair.
The time crept on, and we, shivering somewhat, for the night
grew quite cold, sat ungratefully thinking of the sleep we
were missing, and wondering how we were to awaken ourselves
at four o'clock. At two o'clock they went away, and
we rushed back to bed to seize the two hours of sleep which
remained for us</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;AUTUMN IN THE PASEO DE CORVERAS</h4>


<p>We came back to Murcia, to our headquarters in the
Paseo de Corveras, at the beginning of October.
Though the town was so far south, the cold weather
had well begun. In the daytime the sun seemed as fierce as
ever, but the dust that had lain inches deep during the summer
was now an equal depth of semi-liquid mud, and the house,
without fireplaces or any means of creating artificial warmth,
had in it a faint though insidious chill. Save in the hottest
weather, stone or cement floors are comfortless to live with.
Marciana, the woman whose services we had shared with
Antonio during Rosa's smallpox, returned to us. She was a
woman of sixty years, bulky in figure, dressed in black of an
eternal mourning, and was mother of the most talented
sculptor of Murcia. She was an illustration of the inter-provincial
jealousy of the Spaniard. She came from Don
Quixote's country, La Mancha, and was never weary of chanting
its praises.</p>

<p>"Ah, Señora," she exclaimed, "that is a wonderful land.
Corn, oil and wine in abundance. Dancing and singing in
the villages all night long. And what a wonderful people are
those of mi pueblo.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> My two sisters, they each weigh at
least twice as much as do I. And then we are a civilized
folk there, I can assure you. You saw how they treated it
here when Rosa had the smallpox. No precautions, even
though one died of it a few doors down the street. Now in
mi pueblo they stretch sheets in front of the doors of warning;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the necessaries of life are put on to the doorstep, and the
money to pay for them is dropped by the hands of those who
are in the house, and who are not allowed beyond the sheet,
into pans of vinegar, so that they may be purified of the
disease. Now that is real cleanliness.</p>

<p>"But, thanks to God, Señora, Rosa is much better. The
spots are disappearing, she will not be marked, and she has
given birth to a son. It was a most divine birth. Of course
it was fear for the son that made everybody so anxious."</p>

<p>Marciana was a dilatory servant. Nothing was ever ready
up to date, and she invariably drowned all my commissions
for the market with a flood of words. She would wait all the
morning in the queue which gathered at the Government
Olive Oil depot, to buy olive oil for me at a few centimos
cheaper than she could buy it from the grocers; and no
explanation that she wasted more of our pay than she gained
in cheapness convinced her.</p>

<p>Antonio greeted us with delight, as did Emilio, the guitar maker,
whom we went to visit on the first day of our return.
Each, however, was in a different mood. Antonio, in spite
of the joy caused by his new son, who he said had been
born "most preciously," was in a rage. He was in trouble
with the local authorities about his taxes. It appears that
there is a factory tax which does not depend upon the size
of the business, but the mere fact that there is a business.
Thus Antonio, with his three or four girl helpers, was condemned
to pay the same sum as a factory employing a
thousand hands.</p>

<p>"It is impossible!" shouted Antonio. "We are thus
crushed out of existence. I may be able to arrange it, but, if
I cannot, then it is no use my going on. All the profits are
swallowed up in one gulp. I shall shut down, and sell up
everything."</p>

<p>Emilio, on the other hand, was flushed with unsullied
delight. A pompous man was sitting in his shop with a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
guitar across his knees. Now and then he drew from it a
flourish of arpeggios, very technical, but rather meaningless.
Emilio stood over him, his eyes sparkling at the guitar,
which appeared to be exquisite in tone and strong in volume.</p>

<p>"Aha! my friends, congratulate me," cried he. "I have
surpassed myself. Permit me, Señor." He took the guitar
from the pompous man, and handed it reverently to Jan.
"Try it, only touch it and see what a quality it has. See
how the bass note rings out, and how well-balanced to it is
the treble. I had no more than set the strings out on to it
when Don Feliz, the little maestro whom you know, came in.
He played upon it, and so full was my heart with the perfect
tone of it, and with the thought that I, Emilio Peralta, had
made it, that the tears came running down my face. I wept,
Señor, to hear it. All night long I could not sleep for fear
that the tone might alter, as sometimes it does. Sometimes,
indeed, a guitar newly made sounds of no value, but in a
few days or weeks even it may become first rate. But this
was good from the beginning, and it has remained so."</p>

<p>The pompous man took a stately leave of us. Emilio
was so excited by his new achievement that he went on
talking:</p>

<p>"One does not come to make guitars like this easily.
How many are there alive in Spain to-day who could do it?
Only one, and I am he. Arias is dead, Raminez also, though
I have not seen a Raminez to equal this one. For I will
warrant that there are few better guitars than this in Spain.
Unluckily, it was sold before it was completed, or I would
scarcely have let it go. It was ordered by a colonel in the
Army. Play on it, Señor, but do not play Flamenco, for
you must not tap upon the soundboard, or you will injure
the varnish. This is built for Classical."</p>

<p>Jan played, and it gave out a sonorous arid clear melody.</p>

<p>"From whom did I learn, Señor? I learned from nobody.
My father was a guitar-maker, but a poor one. He taught
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
me nothing. Indeed, I was married before the desire came
to me to make fine instruments. Then how I worked, Señor!
I had an idea of the perfect guitar in my head; but between
idea and accomplishment what a gap! I could not cross it.
Of two guitars, made equally alike, one would be good, the
other useless. When this happened I would take them to
pieces to search for the reason. For years I have lived in
poverty, spoiling good wood which cost me all my earnings.
I have not studied the guitars of others. Always in my head
I carried the idea of the perfect instrument. Slowly I have
struggled towards it. Now I know. But at what a cost
have I acquired knowledge!"</p>

<p>Jan touched a chord on the instrument in his hands, and
as it throbbed out its deep responsive note he remembered
the saying of Chopin: "Nothing is more beautiful than a
good guitar; save perhaps two."</p>

<p>Emilio promised to send Professor Feliz to us as soon as
he came in; and we walked back to the house through the
Murcian mud, which, soaking through our shoes, made us
modify our previous eulogy of the alpagata. On barrows in
the street they were selling the first culled clusters of dates of
the season; we bought both pale and dark varieties, but they
were hard and tasteless. With the dates on the barrows
were the orange fruit of the persimon.</p>

<p>While we had been away at Jijona a cat had taken
possession of our house for the purpose of kittening. How
she had got in was a mystery, for the windows and doors all
had been tightly sealed up, but we had discovered her with
her family at the bottom of the packing-cases which had
formed our bed at Verdolay. We had heard strange faint
sounds as though of mice on the evening of our return. The
noises, however, did not cease for all our presence. We had
gone to explore; suddenly, a noise like a boxful of exploding
matches had burst up from under our noses, and something
black dashed across the dimly lit room and out through the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
window. There were two kittens at the bottom of the
narrowest of the packing-cases. We had moved them to a
large box near to the window. That night there had been a
fearful noise of yowling and squeaking. In the morning we
found the kittens back in the box from which we had moved
them. The cat was quite unapproachable. She burst out
into a fury of spitting whenever we came near. Then with
one final explosion hurried from the room. These wild cats
were the pest of Murcia. One could leave no window open
but they poured into the house. All food had to be securely
shut up, the marks of their dusty paws were everywhere.</p>

<p>When we returned from Emilio's we found that our
presence in the house had been too much for the cat's nerves.
She had disappeared from her box and the kittens were gone
with her.</p>

<p>Don Feliz, the half-blind guitar teacher, came in the
evening. He again said he was an honest man, and that his
terms were five pesetas a month. He was delighted to hear
that we both were to be his pupils. Part of his delight came
from the money he would earn; but some of his delight was
due to the fact that he had ousted Blas as Jan's teacher. I
do not think we have met anybody more inappropriately
named than Don Feliz. If Mr. Shandy's theories have any
foundation he was cursed from his christening. He was not
a Murciano, but a Castilian, and, in consequence, depreciated
the people he lived amongst and was in turn not appreciated
by them. He lived constantly torn by jealousy of the other
guitar-players in the town.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he exclaimed, "what do you think of the
playing of Don Ambrosio?"</p>

<p>Don Ambrosio was the pompous man we had met in
Emilio's shop.</p>

<p>"Technically, excellent, but rather frigid," we said.</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed Don Feliz, "that is it. Frigid, yes,
frigid! Nor is Don Timoteo a good player, and as for that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Blasito, that gipsy&mdash;pah! You see, he has never learned
music. So that, if he does get a good melody from somebody
else, he cannot harmonize it. And his Flamenco is of the
taverns. It is low, common music. Now I play Classical.
Have you heard my piece which represents a battle? How I
imitate the mitrailleuse on the base string? Now that is
quite different from anything which that fellow Blas can
play. Of course I regret that you wish to learn Flamenco.
But that which I will teach you will be a classicized Flamenco.
I have made it into music. You see, I have been in a conservatoire
in my youth. That puts me on a different level
from all these other players. So I have made of my Flamenco
something more refined. It is no longer your tavern
monstrosity that Blas plays."</p>

<p>Personally we preferred Blas as a player, and the music of
Blas as music. But Don Feliz was somewhat better as a
teacher. His conservatoire had taught him at least the names
of the notes. But he was very irritable. Poor fellow, at
twopence a lesson, he had to give a round of thirty lessons
per day to make a bare subsistence. Sometimes he said that
his pupils were so dense that he could teach them but three
or four consecutive notes per day. Once we heard him
debating with a possible client whether it was worth while or
no to walk two miles in order to get three lessons in the same
house. Our consciences&mdash;concerning sweating&mdash;pricked us
and we paid him double fees. In consequence of his gratitude
he came to our house last of all and gave us lessons of four
times the duration of any one else.</p>

<p>After he had gone, we were still playing, when Marciana
came in with some parcels.</p>

<p>"Aha!" she cried. "That is a jota. It is the music of
mi pueblo. La jota, La jota."</p>

<p>She put down the parcels; spread out her arms and with
a balance and elegance extraordinary in one so bulky began
to dance. After twenty bars, however, she stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ei," she sighed, "how sad it is that one grows old.
How sad that youth passes all too quickly!"</p>

<p>That night a terrific thunderstorm broke over the valley.
The thunder crashed, the lightning flared and the rain came
down as though pouring from a gigantic hose. In the middle
of all the noise we heard a strange sound.</p>

<p>"Wah! wah! wah! Squeak! Squeak!"</p>

<p>The cat had come back; but with only one kitten. The
next morning we stayed in the house. From the windows
we could mark the change which autumn had brought over
the Paseo de Corveras. The dust was no longer blown along
the road, which was now a still river of liquid mud. The
town dust-cart, a donkey with panniers, no longer promenaded
the street; no longer did we hear the cheerful blasphemy of the
dust-boy who, stooping to gather up some refuse, found that
his dust-cart had impatiently trotted on. In its place were
the exhortations of the pig-drivers, who urged hordes of
monstrous black pigs through the mud. Some of the porkers
were, however, so heavy on their feet that they had to be
brought in carts. The squealing of them filled the morning
air. The fruit merchants, also with panniered donkeys,
no longer called out "Melacotones, peras!" but "Uvas!
Uvas!"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and a man wandered about with a huge basket of
snails. The maize fields in front of the house were cut and
stacked, and in the fields queens of Sheba were dragging the
primitive ploughs, while men behind them beat to powder
the lumps of baked earth which were turned up. Instead of
the almost dead silence which greeted the strengthening sun,
people moved about all day; parasols had given place to
flirting fans. The country girls wore bunches of flowers in
their hair, some even put one tall blossom sticking upright
from the <i>coiffure</i>, where it nodded and bowed with the movements
of the wearer. In the fruit garden the lemons had
quite fallen, but the oranges were beginning to become a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
livid yellow on one side of the bush, while the dates had
passed from a pale to a deep golden hue.</p>

<p>I went about with Luis exploring balconies for views, and
finally decided upon a view of Murcia from the tall campanile
of the Cathedral. When I got back I found that the cat
once more had decamped, taking the kitten with her. The
second kitten had been lost. In the afternoon Luis came in.
He brought an invitation from some friends for me to play
the piano at their house on Saturday evening. That evening
Don Feliz exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I have an old guitar. It is a unique instrument, none
other like it has ever been seen in Spain. I bought it, at a
bargain, for thirty pesetas; but I would sell it to a friend for
the same money. Now you, Señor, have no guitar of your
own. This is a veritable instrument for a museum. Come
and see it on Sunday morning. I will show you the way."</p>

<p>We dined at Elias', as was our custom, and trudged back
through the mud. On the darkened stairs of our house we
heard a wailing and almost tumbled over the spitting cat,
which had brought back the kitten once more. We gathered
up the kitten and, followed at some distance by the suspicious
cat, put it back into the packing-case.</p>

<p>All this while we were rather short of electric lights in our
house. Antonio had borrowed most of the light-bulbs to
decorate a shrine which he had erected in one of the churches.
The candle which the righteous once offered up to God is
going out of fashion. Nowadays, instead of burning so many
feet of bees-wax, one turns on so many volts. Lamb has
drawn a picture of two priests disputing as to which should
offer up a blessing, with a final compromise that neither
should do so; and the disappointment of the defrauded God.
To-day he could go further, he could depict the deity being
forced to go to the factory chimney for the scent of his burnt
sacrifice. A Spanish writer, Pio Baroja, in a novel proposes
a society called the "Extra-Rapid to Heaven Assurance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Society." The insurer pays in a sum, and on his death
hundreds of gramophones are turned on chanting prayers for
his speedy deliverance from purgatory. "God," says the
author, "is so far away, that he will not notice the substitution."
This is, of course, a satire on the modern habit of
replacing candles by electric lights, but the satire is no more
absurd than the actuality.</p>

<p>Alongside of the bridge was a tall shrine built into the
side of the house and lit up thus at night with electric light.
The image was covered with a large sheet of plate glass, and
I said that it was a sculptured figure. Jan, on the other
hand, insisted that it was a painting. We had an argument
about it and on the next day returned to verify together. It
was, in fact, a painting. But at night, returning from Elias',
we looked up at the shrine by chance, and stopped, astonished.
If it was a painting it was most realistic. We looked more
closely. The more we examined it, the more did it seem
sculptured. Then the explanation dawned on us. It was
sculptured, but during the daytime a painted curtain was
drawn down in front of it.</p>

<p>At luncheon next day we were disturbed by a hullabaloo
from the attic. The wretched cat had taken her kitten up
there, to look for peace from those meddlesome humans.
That night we were awakened again by terrible noises from
under our bed. The cat was still wandering like a lost soul
looking for peace. Daily the kitten appeared and disappeared
with exasperating irregularity. At last, however, we managed
to tame the cat so that we were able to stroke her. Then
the animal burst out into the strangest of noises, like a small
badly oiled circular saw. It was purring. From that moment
it took possession of the house. All its shyness vanished.
It tucked up its sleeves and turned out of the house any
other feline intruder.</p>

<p>One afternoon we were awakened from our siesta by a
furious cat fight underneath the bed. The black cat and a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
ginger-coloured female were locked in combat, and making
a noise like a hundred siphons. The battle continued across
the sitting-room, the ginger cat giving ground. Finally she
retreated to the balcony, where there was for a while armed
neutrality, both singing war songs quite Spanish in their
intervals. Then the black cat sprang. Ginger backed to
avoid the rush, but backed too far. She toppled over into
the street, fell with a thud on to the mud pavement, gathered
herself together and with a scream of disappointed fury dashed
through the nearest open door. To our amazement all the
occupants of the house, a young man, an old woman, a girl
of seventeen and one of six hurried into the street, their eyes
wide open with terror.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" we shouted to them.</p>

<p>"A cat with rabies has just rushed into our house," they
cried in answer.</p>

<p>The fear of rabies is very prevalent, and with reason.
One does not pat stray dogs in Spain, nor does one make
advances to unknown cats. Any animal which can bite is
under suspicion. It is lucky, indeed, that fleas can't get
rabies.</p>

<p>One Saturday I began sketching in the Cathedral campanile.
The ascent of the tower was not by means of steps
but by sloping lanes which travelled all round the inner
walls. I had chosen my view from the belfry. On each side
of me were small bells, and as each in turn clanged out the
half or quarter hour according to size I stopped my ears.
Suddenly there was a deafening crash. Before I realized
what had happened I had fallen from my seat, the easel had
gone spinning ... almost fainting from the shock, I looked
about me. Over my head an enormous clapper was swinging.
Unconsciously, I had seated myself almost inside one of
the biggest bells in the south of Spain, and it had rung. The
clapper again swung itself with force against the side of the
bell, and in spite of my protecting hands the sound burst
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
through my head. For ten minutes afterwards my hand was
shaking too violently to allow me to paint.</p>

<p>The view from the tower was exquisite. Immediately
below me were the blue glazed cupolas and the arabesques of
the cathedral facade on which little stone saints gazed out
over the town. Then came a large square centred on a
circular garden of flowers&mdash;edged on one side by the pink
front of the Archbishop's palace, many windowed. From
the end of the square narrow sunless streets led into the
town, which gradually became a patchwork of flat roofs on
which smaller buildings were erected. The huge square block
of red brick of the Reina Victoria Hotel stood out over the
sinuous river, on the banks of which stood the red pepper
mills and beyond which showed the huertas stretching out to
the mountains. Red, ochre, yellow and green were the chief
colour notes, while blue and purple shadows gave relief and
solidity to the whole.</p>

<p>In the evening I played the piano at the house of Luis'
friends. Here was a typical Spanish bourgeois interior.
Every resting-place was crowded with cheap bric-à-brac.
The chairs were draped with velvet and silk hangings and
antimacassars; the walls hung with enormous photographic
enlargements, from the decorating of which Flores made some
of his living. Card-racks covering the interspaces of the
walls were filled with coloured picture postcards.</p>

<p>"We have brought you here," said Flores, "because it is
just opposite to the Circulo des Varios Artes.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The pianist
of the Arts Club is very conceited. We want to take him
down, by showing him that a Señora can play better than he
does."</p>

<p>I was rather annoyed; but could not draw back. So I
put my best into the music. Grieg (pronounced by them
Hriech) seems to suit the Spanish temperament: so I played
The Wedding March, Papillion and the Carnival. There was
a pause. Then faintly as a retort, from the Circulo des
Varios Artes, came the easiest of Grieg's "lyrical pieces"
played carefully by the maestro. As if he would say, "I too
can play Grieg."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>

<p>On Sunday morning we set off with Don Feliz to see the
old guitar.</p>

<p>"It is in the house of my novia,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> whom I shall be delighted
to introduce to you."</p>

<p>We were amazed. Until that moment we had imagined
Don Feliz to be quite an old man, but looking closely at him
one could see that he might be within the limit of thirty to
forty years. On this second visit to Murcia the people were
not so strongly affected by my appearance in the streets.
For my part I no longer wore a hat, but carried a parasol; I
had exchanged my ordinary dress for an ex-munition overall,
which people said was <i>muy elegante</i>. But we penetrated into
a new part of the town, then was some staring and some
pointing. I mentioned this casually to Don Feliz.</p>

<p>"Do not fear," he exclaimed, "you are safe with me. I
have a terrible reputation in these parts. I am known as a
bad man. If I get into a rage, my anger is terrible to see ...
terrible. The children slink away in the street at my coming."</p>

<p>This was not the estimate we had formed of him, from his
encounter with Blas in Emilio's shop. Poor Don Feliz, like
so many others he had formed a dream self which contained
most of the qualities in which he was lacking. I fear that
only his illusive self was terrible, and that none but dream
children ever shrank at his passing. The house of his novia
bore on its weather-beaten front the arms of some bygone
hidalgo; now it was an apartment house. We clambered
up staircases of black wood, into one of the few dark-coloured
interiors we have seen in Spain. The guitar was of a strange
form and with a scrolled head, the curve of its shape having
some of the beauty to be found in negro sculpture. Jan
seized the bargain, and carried it home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had he the guitar in the house than he tuned it,
and crashing his finger-nails across it, struck out a rasped
chord. He quickly followed it with a shout of dismay. From
out of one of the big holes had crept a startled bug.</p>

<p>After my experience with the church bell I could sympathize
with the insect, weeping perhaps "walrus tears" upon
its death-bed. But the problem of how one could disinfect a
guitar was worrying. The case had no cracks for vermin-harbouring,
so we shut up the instrument; and after some
indecision Jan decided to trust to luck and leave it alone.</p>

<p>On Sunday night we gave a party to Emilio, his wife, the
little Professor and other afficianados of the guitar. We played
to them selections of genuine classical music, Bach, Beethoven,
Handel on the gramophone. Don Feliz sat by himself in a
corner, his head in the air, tapping his foot to the metre.</p>

<p>"All that, all that I have heard before," he said.</p>

<p>Emilio listened with delight on his rugged face. Every
few minutes he whispered to his wife:</p>

<p>"Shut up talking. This is worth listening to."</p>

<p>Then we tried an experiment. We had just received from
El Señor a plate of Stravinsky's "Oiseau du Feu." We put
it on to the machine. The audience kept an intense silence.</p>

<p>"But that is marvellous!" they exclaimed as soon as the
record was over. "Play it once more, Señor."</p>

<p>"Señor," said one of Emilio's friends, "what can I do for
you? Have you any milk&mdash;no?"</p>

<p>He ran downstairs and out of the house. In ten minutes
he came back, thrust a milk-can into Jan's hands.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed. "And if you want any more
cow's milk, come to me. I keep a milk-shop, you know."
Then he went on more seriously: "But you are indeed
lucky to have bought that old guitar of Don Feliz. He
would never sell it to me. I have offered a hundred pesetas
for it; and there are others who have offered more."</p>

<p>This left us with a problem in psychology to work out for
the next few days. Why had Don Feliz sold Jan the guitar?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>We put the question to Luis.</p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, "probably Don Feliz found the Señor
Juan sympathetic."</p>

<p>But this did not satisfy us. Don Feliz had made much of
the fact that we were leaving the country: that we were
going far away. At last we worked it out thus.</p>

<p>Don Feliz had bought his novia a laud. He was short of
money to pay for it. This, however, would not have been
enough reason in itself, but he was also jealous of the other
players in the town, and by selling the guitar definitely to
Jan he would first allay the temptation that he might sell it
locally. He put the price low, because he knew we were
badly off; but some of the wrench of parting with the
instrument&mdash;of which he was very proud&mdash;was eased by knowing
that it was going to be taken to the grand cities of London
and Paris, where its uniqueness would be valued. But we
think he would have died of starvation rather than allow one
of his local rivals to possess his old guitar.</p>

<p>When I was not sketching in the campanile, Jan and I
went to the cafés and drew the people sitting about us. This
gave delight to the waiters. One morning while we were at
one of the café's facing the river Blas came up. He passed
over the fact that we had quarrelled, and that Jan had
dropped him for Don Feliz.</p>

<p>"Draw me!" said Blas.</p>

<p>The result was that one by one all the richest gipsies of
the town came and posed to me at the café tables. This
was, in fact, the gipsies' café. They were on the whole a
handsome set of men, very intelligent and shrewd in expression
and of prosperous appearance. Most of these carried the
indefinable touch which makes an internationalism amongst
those who are interested in beasts of burden. They are
reputed to be expert cattle and horse thieves, and are still
to some extent despised by the Spaniard. But our first
impressions were not unfavourable.</p>

<p>The autumn seemed to be a period of fiesta. We had
luckily just missed the great fiesta of Murcia which culminates
with a huge procession out to Fuen Santa in the mountains.
But often we were awakened at three in the morning by a
series of alarming reports and explosions in the street outside.
There was a large church at the end of the Paseo de Corveras,
and it seemed as though guns were going off all around the
walls. The first time we heard this we sprang to our windows,
for we had heard something of the quarrelsome nature of the
Murcians. But the explosions were up in the air. Rocket
after rocket soared up into the air and exploded with a loud
crash, then large zigzag crackers were thrown down into the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
street. Grumbling at the noise, we went back to bed. Next
day we found out that it was a fiesta, the rockets sent up by
the priests; and often after that we were awakened in the
dead of night by these almost Chinese religious ceremonies.</p>

<p>We had heard much of the quarrelsome nature of the
huertanos. Luis and Flores had both told us tales of quarrels
amongst the cultivators. Both at Verdolay and in Murcia
we had seen small bands of young men wandering about at
eventide with guitars and songs. They were hunting for
trouble, and if they should meet another band, then a fight
ensued, ending with broken instruments and possibly a stab
or two.</p>

<p>One afternoon Jan was walking homewards from Emilio's,
where he had been buying guitar-strings. He was close to
the Paseo de Corveras, when a young man rushed round a
corner and cannoned hard into him. Jan stumbled and to
save himself clutched the man by the coat. It was a corner
around which youths were accustomed to lark, and Jan,
believing this to be a piece of horse-play, decided, while yet
stumbling and clutching, that the horse-play was too rough.
So dragging at the blouse of the man, who struggled to
escape, Jan exhorted him to come back and to explain himself.
While he was still holding on to the man, a crowd burst
around the corner and flung itself on to the presumed joker.
Jan's head was in a whirl. One man leapt fiercely on to the
joker's back, wrenched his arms behind him and grasped
him. The struggling crowd swayed to and fro and suddenly
lurched sideways through the door of a tobacconist's shop.
Two women in the shop began to shriek at the upper pitch of
their voices.</p>

<p>The turmoil quietened. A furious talk began in the shop.
The young man who had pinioned the joker, trying to explain,
loosened his grip to use his hands conversationally. At once
the joker leapt for freedom. He ran, panting like a dog, out
of the shop, the crowd bellowing, amid screaming, at his
heels. The man was chased into an ironmonger's, where he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
took refuge behind the counter. The crowd blocked up the
doorway. Jan, who had joined the crowd in dismayed
curiosity, then began to pick up detached words: "Asesino,
Asesino ... asesinato."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Jan to himself. "I don't want to
get mixed up in a murder trial."</p>

<p>As he turned away, two gendarmes, with the ridiculous
schoolgirl hats on their heads, led the murderer away.</p>

<p>During this time I had been at home. A sudden outburst
of noise dragged me to the window. Down the street, a man
was running. He went in a queer way, holding himself
between the legs with his hands, and sometimes stumbling,
sometimes leaping as one does in dreams of pursuit. Carts
were driven furiously after him. He was shouting out in a
voice, full of surprise and of anger. After a moment I made
out the words:</p>

<p>"Catch the man who has murdered me! Catch the villain
who has killed me!"</p>

<p>He stumbled once more and fell. Men jumped from the
carts, lifted him into one, and drove him away.</p>

<p>I ran downstairs. Antonio's gaunt mother-in-law was
standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>"It is an assassination," she said. "I doubt that the
poor man will live. He was stabbed in a ticklish part."</p>

<p>"I wonder where Jan is," I said to myself; and at that
moment saw him coming along the sidewalk. I ran to him.
"Jan," I cried, "a man has been murdered."</p>

<p>"I know," he answered; "I unwittingly caught the
murderer."</p>

<p>The Paseo de Corveras must have more than its fair
percentage of fat old women. They all stood on their doorsteps
talking in awed tones of the tragedy. Then with a
ludicrous unanimity each pushed her skirts between her legs
with a dramatic hand and holding herself so that she plainly
illustrated her meaning exclaimed,</p>

<p>"Ei! el pobre! Y en un sitio tan delicado."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h4>LORCA</h4>


<p>We still had money for another three weeks, although
we had been four months in Spain. The weather in
Murcia was very cold; damp, chilling winds blew
down the valley. We decided to go westwards, to explore
Lorca, which we had heard was both fine pictorially and also
which was called "the City of the Sun." On suggesting
the idea to some of our Murcian friends, they advised us
not to go. "It is a town of bad people," they said;
"they are all gipsies." We had heard before of these towns
of bad people. One lay on the far side of the Murcian valley;
a village which clustered round the foot of the peak of rock
on the top of which was a ruined castle. These people had
the reputation of chasing out intruding strangers with sticks
and stones. Antonio, fishing in the vicinity of this village,
had once been maltreated. The villagers were proud of this
brutality.</p>

<p>"Yes," they would say, "we <i>are</i> brutes. We <i>are</i> uncultivated.
We are the biggest brutes for fifty miles around, and
we mean to remain so."</p>

<p>Other people had said that Lorca was charming. So we
decided to find out for ourselves. We hoped to find rooms in
a posada, and we reduced our luggage to moderate dimensions;
most of it we put in the van, leaving ourselves only the guitar
and the laud to look after.</p>

<p>The train left early in the morning, and stopped at the
first station, where we had to change. We rushed across the
line, having to clamber under a long train of waggons which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
blocked the way, and won corner seats. A lanky boy of
eighteen, dressed in a long white travelling ulster, with a
<i>béret</i> on his head, took most of the other seats in the carriage,
filling them with packages. The young man seemed very
familiar with railway travelling: he called all the porters by
name, and exchanged smokes with the engine-driver.</p>

<p>But the train did not move. Presently the youth came
back and said:</p>

<p>"The engine is a bad one. It won't start. They are
sending to Murcia for another."</p>

<p>He went away once more. A luggage train rumbled into
the station. This brought our boy back with a rush.</p>

<p>"Here," he cried, "spread out, spread out as much as
you can. It's an agricultural train, and we shall be swamped
with labourers."</p>

<p>He pushed his boxes and packages more widely over the
seats. His prediction was justified. A horde of unshaven
men, carrying sacks and implements clambered up the side
of the train and peered with round eyes into the windows.</p>

<p>"No room here, no room here," cried the youth.</p>

<p>"But there is nobody in the carriage," protested one of
the agriculturists.</p>

<p>"They are in the fonda," said the youth.</p>

<p>In spite of the energies of officials accommodation could
not be found. Soon the agriculturists were wailing their
protests, wandering forlornly up and down. At last the heart
of our youth was softened.</p>

<p>"Here," he cried. "Room for two. Got to let some in,"
he added to us in an undertone, "or they'll push the lot in
on us."</p>

<p>The two who accepted the invitation were very subservient,
almost cringing, and we stowed their sacks and
other luggage between our legs. They talked together in
hoarse whispers. In time most of the peasants were placed,
but one man who carried an enormous sack of potatoes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
seemed to be unplaceable, for he refused to be parted from his
sack. The officials said the sack was too big for carriage
traffic: it ought to go in the van. But no protestation
moved the owner. He was determined that, come what might,
he and his sack would never part. Eventually, as usually
happens in Spain, he was allowed to do as he liked. He and
his sack were crushed into another carriage.</p>

<p>Then ensued another dreary wait, and at last, three hours
late, the train drew out of Alcantarilla.</p>

<p>As soon as we were well under way, the youth said:
"I'm off to a second-class carriage."</p>

<p>He opened the carriage door, got down on to the running
board and clambered off. After half an hour he returned.</p>

<p>"They collect tickets round about here," he said.</p>

<p>Sure enough within ten minutes came the ticket collector.</p>

<p>The train stopped at a station. The youth got out on to
the platform with a carriage whip and a square parcel, which
he handed to a waiting man, for which service he received
money. This he did at other stations, and gradually we
realized what was his occupation. In one part of Murcia we
had noted shops which called themselves Agencies. They
had large notices saying, "Commissions for Lorca, for Barcelona,
for Zaragoza, etc., etc."</p>

<p>We had not understood their purport, but by some jump
of intuition connected the youth with these shops. He was
the only Spanish substitute for the parcels post.</p>

<p>At Totana two gipsy women came into the carriage, very
friendly and talkative. At the next station the two workmen
left us. In the carriage they had appeared good-humoured,
inadequate morsels of humanity. But they descended into
the bosoms of their family. Wives and daughters crowded
round them and seized and shouldered their bags, packs, sacks
and implements. The men seemed to swell out like a dry
thing cast into water, blooming like a dead sea lily as they
stood receiving the caresses of their womenfolk. The last
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
we saw of the more insignificant of the two was a picture of
him striding like a king along the dusty road to the village
with his family in humble though happy procession behind.
Well does the Spanish proverb say, "It is better to be the head
of a mouse than the tail of a lion."</p>

</div>

<p>Two gendarmes&mdash;greenish khaki in uniform, with the
schoolgirlish helmets&mdash;armed with rifles took the place
of the peasants. The younger gipsy woman addressed them.
One of the gendarmes grunted, the other glared his eye round
and said nothing. Again she made a remark, and again there
was no reply. Then she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it <i>was</i> you who arrested José."</p>

<p>"Well," answered the gendarme with a beard, "what of
it?</p>

<p>"But why did you arrest him?" said the gipsy. "He
was innocent. He did not murder Ramon."</p>

<p>"So you say."</p>

<p>"But it is true. He is a cousin of Conchita here. He was
at her house that evening. There is no evidence."</p>

<p>"There was enough to get him arrested."</p>

<p>"But that was all made up. You see, Esteban hates him,
and Esteban got up that false evidence. You look up what
Esteban was doing. I don't say that he was the murderer,
but he knows something about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, he knew that José did it."</p>

<p>"But I tell you José was with Conchita here."</p>

<p>"Well, tell that to the Judge. It is nothing to do with
me. I was told to arrest José and I arrested him. Hum"&mdash;he
looked at Conchita&mdash;"I suppose she is going to see him
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are going to see José. Poor fellow, and him
innocent."</p>

<p>"Well, if his defence is all right, he'll get off. If it isn't,
he won't&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>We did not think that José's neck was in any danger.
We had gained an impression that the average sentence for
casual murder in Spain is about two or three years' imprisonment.
This conversation went on for some time. The gipsies
talked round the subject, over it, under it, twisted it inside
out and outside in. With all these variations it lasted till
we arrived at Lorca, when we all, gipsies, gendarmes, agency
boy and ourselves, got down from the train.</p>

<p>We put our luggage into the luggage-room and set out to
look for the town, which we had learned by experience would
be found at some distance from the station. A boy who carried
a rope over his shoulder accosted us, but we declined his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
services. We strode out into a dusty road, and there stood
undecided, for there were two paths to choose from. The boy
with the rope, who now had a huge box on his shoulders, came
up, and saying, "Follow me, Señores," walked on. We looked
at him and realized that here again we had touched the East.
Here was a cord porter straight out of <i>The Arabian Nights</i>.
The rope was round the box and he held it to his shoulders.
With his rope he earned his living. We followed him, asking
him for some place where we could eat. He named the dearest
hotel at once. We declined, explaining that we wanted the
cheapest possible, that is, as long as the cooking was fit
to eat.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said. "Follow me."</p>

<p>The long avenue of lime trees came to an end&mdash;and our
first view of Lorca was opened out. The town was almost
like a mathematical line, length without breadth. It skirted
the foot of a hill for three miles, almost one long street, which
we were looking at end on. Spires towered into the air, and
on the top of the cliff the walls of a great Saracen ruin overlooked
the town. The whole hill-side, between town and
castle, was covered with the grotesque foliage of the prickly
pear. The cord porter took us down to the river, which was
crossed by a plank, then up into the town. He led us through
small streets which fringed the great main street, put down his
box at a corner, led us up another street and stopped at a high
barricaded gate. Two filthy children were playing on the
step. The cord porter rapped with his knuckles. There
was no answer. He rapped again loudly. A hoarse voice
cried out in questioning reply.</p>

<p>"It's Paco," shouted the porter. "I've got two customers
here."</p>

<p>A quarrel ensued through the keyhole.</p>

<p>There was a sound of a rusty lock and the door swung
open. A woman heated with cooking and with annoyance
began to curse the cord porter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why couldn't you bring them to the proper entrance?"
she cried.</p>

<p>But she let us in, took us through a yard in which huge
stew-pots and frying-pans were cooking over a wood fire,
and ushered us upstairs, past rooms filled with workmen
diners, into a long chamber lit by a window at one end, with
bullfight posters on the walls. She brought us a plate of stew
and wine. We asked for bread.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring your own?" she said.</p>

<p>"We did not know," we answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. I'll give you bread this time. But, next
time, bring your own bread with you."</p>

<p>We thought, "Lorca is a rough place." There was a sound
of loud chaffing, and in walked our agency boy of the train.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he exclaimed to us. "Are you here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," we answered. "And, now we see you here, we
are sure this is the best place."</p>

<p>He grinned, chucked the waitress under the chin, and
ordered a complex meal. As soon as the staff perceived our
acquaintance with the agency boy, their manners changed.
They became charming, inquiring after our need with a lively
solicitude. We asked the diners about a posada. A bluff
man, with a walrus moustache, seated at the same table, said
the posada at which he was staying was comfortable.</p>

<p>"When you have finished your meal," he said, "I will
lead you there and introduce you to the proprietor, an excellent
fellow. But you come unluckily. To-day is market day.
There are many farmers in from the country, and it is possible
that you will find difficulties."</p>

<p>As we went out the waitress came running after us. "You
have left your bread behind," she cried.</p>

<p>With our new friend we went off. But the posada was
full for the night.</p>

<p>"There is another one, we will look at that," said our
guide. "If the other is full also, you shall have my room,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and I will find a bed somewhere until a room is free. Tomorrow
the place will be emptier."</p>

<p>On the way to the second posada, we fell in once more
with the cord porter.</p>

<p>"You are looking for rooms," he cried. "Why didn't you
tell me before? I know of a splendid place. I will lead you
there."</p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">
    <tr>
      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i251.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>"Perhaps that will be better," said the man. "I do not
think the other posada would really suit you. They say it
is the meeting-place of loose women. You understand?"</p>

<p>The cord porter took us to a house outside of which were
about ten hen-coops. In the midst of the coops an old woman
was sitting on a low chair. She was an extraordinary shape;
like a Chinese lucky image, Hotei. Her knees were perched
on the rung of the chair, and so large was her stomach that it
rose in front of her like a balloon, coming in its highest part
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
well to the level of her chin. She looked dingy and unwashed,
but we could not well draw back, for the cord porter had told
her our needs. The obese woman stood up, balancing her
fantastic stomach by a backward bend of the spine.</p>

<p>She had two rooms, one with a single bed, one with a
couple. The single bed was small, the ceiling looked as if it
were not innocent of vermin. We chose the double-bedded
room after the conventional bargaining.</p>

<p>"You will indeed be better there," said our friend. "Two
beds are better than one."</p>

<p>The cord porter was commissioned to fetch our luggage
and we went off with the other man. We had invited him
to take coffee with us. He preceded us to a small <i>buvette</i>,
and the waiter showed us into a room partitioned into private
boxes by means of canvas screens.</p>

<p>"Here one is at one's ease," said our acquaintance.
We told him that we were painters.</p>

<p>"I am a zapatero,"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> he said. "I have been here some
weeks looking for work. My proper town is Aguilas, though
I was born here. But Aguilas is not large. There was
another zapatero in the town. The people all took their work
to him. They said, 'He is a fool, but you are clever. Therefore
he can make a living only where he is known, and where
folks sympathize with him; while you can easily make good
elsewhere.' So I had to come away. But times are bad.
They say that there are too many zapateros in Lorca already.</p>

<p>"Times are so bad in Lorca," he went on, "that I don't
expect you will do the business here that you hope. Now,
if you are the painters you ought to be, I have a proposal to
make. You come with me to some towns I know of down
the coast. You will put up your easel in the main street,
and will paint, and I will sell lottery tickets at three goes for
the real. We will do a splendid business. I can assure you
that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the offer come at another moment we would have
jumped at the chance of the fun. But we had a London
Exhibition hanging over our heads. We dared not waste
the time. This we explained to the zapatero, adding also
our regrets and how well the idea would have gone in
the book we were projecting. His expression altered at
once.</p>

<p>"Books?" said he. "You are book people?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But," he persisted, "you don't mean to say that you are
that kind of persons? Not with <i>those</i> books that Englishmen
come selling. You are book people"&mdash;his voice rose with
indignation&mdash;"you have to do with those Bibles!"</p>

<p>Shades of Borrow! we roared with laughter. Somewhat
reassured the zapatero resumed his seat. We explained.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "I did not think that you could be that
sort of persons and yet ... You are English. I," he added
proudly, "am an Atheist! Of course I let my little boy
read <i>that</i> book, one has to learn to read somehow. But I
say to him, 'Don't believe it. Use it if you like, but don't
be taken in by it.'"</p>

<p>We went back to the house to find that our luggage had
arrived. A button was coming loose from my boot, so the
zapatero borrowed needle and cotton and sewed it on professionally.
Then, as he said he liked the guitar, we took out
our instruments and began to play. The female Hotei ran
into the entrada waving her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," she cried, "you mustn't play here! You
mustn't play here! The owner of this house died three days
ago, so we cannot allow any music here. It would show the
greatest disrespect."</p>

<p>We said au revoir to the zapatero, and went out to examine
Lorca. The houses on one side of the long street had swelled
up the hill towards the Saracen castle. Through this we went
clambering upwards. In appearance it was the oldest town
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
we had seen. The houses were of all shapes, but of a uniform
colour, like yellow rust, and the earth was of the same tint.
The houses piled themselves up in fine shapes, but Lorca
suffered from the same drawback as Murcia, a drawback we
had feared: it was too big. Had we attempted to sketch in
the streets we should have been swamped by people as I had
been in the market-place. The streets were full of men sitting
in groups making alpagatas. They called out after us as we
passed. The songs were different from those of Murcia or
Jijona. Here is one, a guajiras which a woman was singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love is an insect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which enters the body,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no rest is left there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it takes possession.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It gnaws like a wood-louse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tree where it burrows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in time it devours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Volition and strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving only desires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the one who is worshipped."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We scrambled up to the castle and from thence found a
view of the surrounding country. On the south there was a
passage not unlike that of Murcia, a flat cultivated valley;
but to the north it looked as though giants had been at mining
operations. The hills looked not like the result of nature but
of artifice, they appeared to be huge mine dumps and slag
heaps. It was fantastic and unpaintable. The town itself
was too much like the conventionally picturesque mud
coloured compositions of Southern Europe that every painter
brings back from his travels, and we decided that Lorca was
not a painting ground for us; and that we would go back to
Murcia on the following day, looking for some suitable spot at
which to paint on the homeward route to Barcelona.</p>

<p>We came down by a different path, passing a cluster of
seven white hermitages built on a square plateau. They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
were small box-like structures, and once, we believe, hermits
did live in them, but now they are deserted. We reached
Mrs. Hotei's house both tired and hungry. A crowd of women
in black had just returned from the landlord's funeral. They
consented to boil us some eggs for supper, which we ate
under Mrs. Hotei's piercing eyes. From the ceiling of the
supper-room hung clusters of quinces, and on the mantelpieces
were some interesting specimens of antique Spanish
pottery.</p>

<p>We went to bed early, and to our dismay found that one
of the beds had been taken away. There was no washing
apparatus in the room, and the window looking on to the
road was curtained by an old dirty sack.</p>

<p>"Well," said we, "we are in for it. Pray Heaven that
there are no bugs."</p>

<p>As we were about to undress we heard scuffling and
giggling which drew our attention to another drawback, one
to which we would not submit. There was a second door to
our room, half glazed, and the glass was covered by a hanging
drapery. But this drapery, which was outside the glass, had
been pulled aside, and a row of faces of curious children were
staring in on us. We rang the bell. The daughter of Mrs.
Hotei was half surprised at our objection to publicity and
that we were so squeamish about undressing as a popular
spectacle. But we persuaded her to pin up a pink shawl on
our side of the door, and we then went to bed.</p>

<p>To bed, but not to sleep.</p>

<p>The bed was distressingly narrow. We could remain in it
by clinging together, but if we loosened our grip, one or the
other began to roll out. After some while Jan had ideas of
getting out and of sleeping on the floor, but the floor was
of stone and the only mat in the room was small and circular.
Our determination to leave Lorca strengthened as the night
wore on. At last we found a partial solution, we lashed ourselves
together with the blankets. When sheer weariness was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
making us doze off, a man upstairs began to take off his boots.
The floors were thin, and he seemed to be a centipede. Boot
after boot he hurled into a corner, but even his feet were not
inexhaustible, and at last we slept fitfully.</p>

<p>We awoke very early, grateful at least that no bugs had
disturbed us. In spite of the many warnings we had had of
the verminous condition of Spain, it has not been our experience
to encounter in the provinces of Murcia and Alicante
even as much insect life as one might easily find in Chelsea.
Fleas, of course, there are, but in a hot dusty country fleas
are to be expected.</p>

<p>Washing things were brought on demand, though I think
they had expected us to wash at the public sink in the outhouse.
Then we breakfasted on bread, coffee and grapes,
while Mrs. Hotei sat by resting her stomach on the edge of
the table and chanting in a hollow voice a pæan of her own
virtues. It ran somewhat thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>In this plain song she explained both the disappearance of
our second bed and the centipedal man upstairs. When she
had finished we broke to her the news of our imminent departure.
We lunched once again at the eating-house, which this
day was full of peasants. Three women in black who might
have stepped out of the pages of the Bible faced us. They
were not friendly in manner. A small soldier, half tipsy,
came in and, soon after him, the agency youth. The latter
began to tease the tipsy soldier, and in a short while both had
pulled out knives and were threatening each other in mock
earnestness. But one could see that it needed little&mdash;an
accidental word, a sentence misunderstood&mdash;to swing the
drunken soldier over from joking to earnest. We took coffee
at a café in the central street. La gorda rolled up the street,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
came to our table, and accepted a glass of anis dulce for the
illness of her stomach.</p>

<p>We set off to the station followed by a small boy wheeling
our luggage on a barrow. As I went people shouted after me:
"Sombrero, Sombrero." The train was, of necessity, late.
We sat down in the station hall, and the gipsy woman who
had come from Totana joined us. A blind woman led by a
child took up her position at the booking-office exit, cunningly
begging from the folk as they were handling their small
change. The small child had one bad eye and was wiping
both eyes with the same handkerchief. One could see that
she, too, was threatened with blindness. The zapatero came,
having dined at a friend's house.</p>

<p>A good deal of farm produce was being prepared for the
train. There were crates of chickens, which were thrown about
from hand to hand; but some unfortunate turkeys were not
even as lucky as the hens. About twenty of them were packed
loosely into a large net bag. The porter picked up each bag
and, the turkeys squeaking loudly, pitched it up to a man who
was standing in the truck. The bags were packed one on the
top of another with a total lack of consideration for the turkeys'
feelings. There is no S.P.C.A. in Spain.</p>

<p>Jan told the zapatero that if he were coming to Murcia
he could give him an address which might be useful. He
then wrote Antonio's name and direction, which the zapatero
accepted almost with reverence. Jan went off to the ticket-office,
while I, aided by the zapatero, found a carriage in the
train, which had just arrived. The gipsy woman came with
us; and an old man also got into the carriage. Up and down
the platform a hawker was walking with a broad basket over
his arm. He was selling thin circular cakes. I bought five,
one for each person in the carriage. The old man accepted the
cake which I offered him, took a large bite, ruminated for a
moment over it and remarked:</p>

<p>"These cakes value nothing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>The zapatero and the gipsy woman each took a bite.
Opinion seemed unanimous. I then bit in my turn. The
cake had a queer taste: it was something like a thin cold
muffin flavoured with cayenne pepper. The gipsy woman
collected the cakes, each with a bite out of it (like the mad
hatter's saucer), and put them into her basket, saying, "Oh,
the children won't grumble at them." But I was determined
that Jan should have the experience.</p>

<p>As he came out of the ticket-office he was intercepted by
the cake-sellers, who said to him:</p>

<p>"Señor, you have a wife, who is a remarkable woman."
The old man turned to the zapatero.</p>

<p>"Who are these people?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The zapatero began to give an account of us.</p>

<p>"They are painters," he said; "they travel about the
country making pictures with paint and brushes, not with a
machine. Not content with that they are amateur musicians,
and can play. There are their instruments. But better
than all this they can read and write; and what is more I can
prove it."</p>

<p>With an air of pride he drew from his bosom the card on
which Jan had written Antonio's address.</p>

<p>The old man took it. He perched a pair of horn spectacles
on his nose and read the address through from end to end.</p>

<p>Then he handed the treasure back solemnly to the
zapatero.</p>

<p>"And very well done too," he said.</p>

<p>We said good-bye to the zapatero, and the train drew out
of the station some two hours late. Gradually the night
darkened. There was a long wait at Alcantarilla, and we
arrived at Murcia within the four hours' limit which one must
place on the Spanish time-table. We left our van luggage
to be collected in the morning, and carrying our instruments
in our hands walked back to the Paseo de Corveras</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

<h4>MURCIA&mdash;LAST DAYS</h4>


<p>Next morning we sent Marciana to tell Jesus, the water-carrier,
to bring our registered luggage from the
station. After a long delay she came back saying that
no luggage with a number corresponding to that of the receipt
was to be found. We set off through the mud to the station,
and after having suffered from some lack of courtesy on the
part of one or two of the clerks we were able to convince
ourselves that Jesus had spoken the truth. Our luggage,
consisting of a suit-case, a rucksack and a hold-all, containing
all our warm clothes, our painting materials, all our drawings
of the past five months, was missing. We were assured that
we had nothing to be anxious about. The next train from
Lorca would arrive about six-thirty, and the things which
<i>must</i> have been left behind at Lorca would come on by it.
But the Spanish reassurances had no foundation, the baggage
did not come, and the baggage officials confessed themselves
astounded. "Such a thing," they said, "has never happened
before." The station-master, a short, portly, grumpy fellow,
at first refused to listen to our complaints. When at last we
compelled him to do so, he shrugged his shoulders and said,
"It is a fatality." After some pressing, however, he consented
to telegraph to Lorca, and to telephone to Alcantarilla, the
junction.</p>

<p>The next day no news was forthcoming of our luggage,
and the station-master was hostile. He saw in us persons
who were troubling the peaceful round of his easy duties.
The other station officials said plainly the baggage had gone
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
to Madrid by mistake, or perhaps to Carthagena. But neither
Lorca, Alcantarilla, Madrid nor Carthagena would confess
knowledge of our errant luggage. We were indeed in rather
an awkward situation. We had reserved just enough money
with which to travel homewards, but were now faced with the
prospect of a long stay in Murcia waiting till our luggage
was found and, if it continued missing, with the purchase
of many necessary articles which we now lacked. For instance,
we had no boots, having made the journey in alpagatas.</p>

<p>By this time, of course, Antonio, and indeed, through the
agency of Marciana and of Jesus, the whole quarter had
learned of our misfortune. Antonio arranged for a meeting
with a clerk of some commercial firm. This clerk's chief
occupation seemed to be the pestering of the Spanish railways
for lost objects, and he entered with gusto into our affair.
He made us work out a list of our losses and added on a thousand
pesetas to our total, which he said was ridiculously underestimated.
Then we went, backed by Antonio, to the railway
station.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" snarled the station-master, as he
saw us appear once more.</p>

<p>"These Señores have come to make a claim," said
Antonio.</p>

<p>"Ha ha!" said the station-master, grinning. "They
won't be able to do so. They are foreigners, and will not be
able to write it out properly."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," answered the clerk. "I am here to write it
properly in their names, and they will sign it. This will be
sufficient."</p>

<p>After a short argument the station-master gave way.
He took us into an office and spread out before us a large book.
It seemed that the railway companies had made ample
provision for recording losses.</p>

<p>The clerk opened it, tucked up his sleeves, squared his
elbows, and in careful orthography began to shape on the page
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
a complex document, full of Spanish equivalents for "whereas"
and "wherefore." When the signing was completed we went
home.</p>

<p>"I have given them a week in which to find the luggage,"
said the clerk. "After that delay is over, they will have to
pay you. Even if the luggage is recovered the day after the
week is up, you may refuse it, and demand the cash in its
place."</p>

<p>We went home to count up our diminishing resources:
"Here is a week," said we, "here are two pairs of boots."
We had heard rumours of boats which travelled round the
coast, and understanding these to be cheaper than the railways
we made inquiries; but Murcia was just too far from the sea
to be interested in shipping, and we had to give up the idea
of reaching France by this means.</p>

<p>Murcia was bitterly cold during those days of waiting.
Our warmer underclothes were lost with the luggage, and our
friend's house, wonderfully cool on the hottest day of summer,
was frigid in the damp, rainy autumn. We had nothing
to do, for all our materials were missing, and one could not
make excursions on foot, because the roads were deep in mud.
So we waited, shivering, until we could escape from a country
which had no suitable appliances for warming its chilled
inhabitants.</p>

<p>We at last came to the end of the week's grace, and the
luggage had not appeared. So, finding that the process of
extracting payment from the railways was going to be a long
one, we decided to give Antonio a power of attorney to manage
the affair for us. We were assured that payment would
certainly be made eventually, though with a little delay.
Antonio took charge of arrangements to draw up the necessary
papers, while we set to packing what remained to us of luggage,
including the large Sevillian basin given to us by La Merchora.
At last everything was ready; on the following day we were
to sign the papers in the presence of a lawyer, and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
next day we were to set out for Alicante by the morning
train.</p>

<p>On the morning of the last day, while we were sewing La
Merchora's Sevillian basin into a huge rush basket which was
to protect it from damage on the journey, we looked out of the
window and saw, somewhat to our dismay, a fat, familiar figure
strolling along the pavement. The bootmaker had arrived
from Lorca hunting for work.</p>

<p>In spite of a feeling of gratitude which we entertained
towards him for the help he had given us at Lorca, we could
not but wish that he had come at some other time. Our day
would be as full as we could well manage. The complications
which might be added by having to dance attendance on the
zapatero filled us with dismay. To our relief the bootmaker
sauntered on towards the town. Selfishly we hoped that he
would leave us alone. We had told Antonio about him, and
both Luis and Flores had promised to help him to find work
when he arrived.</p>

<p>Commissions called us into the town, and we slunk along
the streets, spying for a portly form. But upon our return
we met it, coming out of Antonio's house. Our Fate could not
be avoided, so we asked him in to a simple lunch, at which
we put before him, amongst other things, a large dish of especially
selected olives which we had bought to take back with us
to England. The zapatero approved so much of our taste
in olives that, to our dismay, he almost finished up our store;
and in consequence we had to waste more of our precious time
in buying a new supply. We might indeed have saved ourselves
the trouble: we were fated to reach England without
olives, for the bottle holding them was afterwards forgotten
and left in a railway waiting-room. After lunch we dismissed
the zapatero, hinting to him as broadly as we could that we
now had a lot to do, but that we would be delighted to see
him at about seven o'clock, by which time our business would
be over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>However, when at three o'clock we called at Antonio's
house to bring him to the lawyer's office at which the power
of attorney was to be signed, the zapatero was sitting comfortably
in one of the rocking-chairs awaiting our arrival. We
suggested to him that we had business to attend to. He replied
that he would accompany us into the town.</p>

<p>So Antonio, the clerk, the zapatero, Jan and I set out for
the lawyer's office. We had expected the bootmaker to leave
us on the threshold, but he stalked gravely in our rear, and
introduced himself to the lawyer's clerks as a friend of the
family. The lawyer's office was a large apartment with a
black and white tiled floor, at one end of which was the clerk's
table and at the other that of the lawyer. He was a thick-set
man covered with a huge golfing cap in loud checks. Over his
head was suspended from the ceiling, with outstretched wings,
a stuffed and dilapidated eagle from which generations of
moth had stolen all hint of beauty. We discovered that this
eagle, in some form or another, is the recognized trademark
of the lawyer. One is tempted to wonder if this bird of prey
hovers thus emblematically over the head of the man of
law as a sort of symbolic warning to the simple-minded
peasants.</p>

<p>The legal preliminaries were brought to a stop by the
discovery that Jan had forgotten the passports; so, while
he set off in a hurry to get them, we sat around in an uncomfortable
circle. Meanwhile the chill from the tiled floor crept
upwards through my feet. To break the silence the lawyer
began to pay me the usual compliments on my Castilian.
Immediately in came the zapatero.</p>

<p>"She is a talented lady," he exclaimed. "Not only
does she speak English in addition to our language, but she
can paint pictures, and play on musical instruments. These
I have seen and heard myself. Furthermore, she has other
talents: she can read and write, and so can her husband.
In case you do not believe this latter statement I can prove it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<div align="center">
  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="600">

      <td align="center"><img src="./images/i265.jpg" width="600" alt=" " /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Whereupon he pulled from his pocket the address which
Jan had written for him at Lorca and, unfolding it with some
solemnity, placed it on the lawyer's desk. The latter, perceiving
nothing humorous in the zapatero's action, read the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
writing gravely and handed it back with expressions of
approval.</p>

<p>But the arrival of Jan with the passports by no means
seemed to satisfy the lawyer. He turned the papers over
and over and said that with these nothing could be done.
After much difficulty we discovered that no justice could be
claimed in Spain unless one were registered at the municipal
offices. The tax for registration depended upon one's station
and possessions. There was just time, with luck, to get ourselves
registered before the offices were shut; so, fearful that
we should miss another day, we hurried through the narrow
Murcian streets, led by Antonio and followed by the bootmaker.
On the way a sudden doubt attacked Jan. His passport name
is Godfrey Jervis, but he generally signs himself by his pen-name
of "Jan." Thoughtlessly he had signed the claim in
the station book "Jan" and was afraid that if this name was
not entered in the other papers a legal flaw might be entailed.
The municipal registry office was a long, dark passage pierced
with small, square, deep-set pigeon-holes and about large
enough to admit the passage of a head. Through one of these
holes we made our claim, asking for tramps' certificates&mdash;the
cheapest of all. My municipal paper was filled in easily
enough, but we had a tough struggle to induce the official to
alter "Godfrey Jervis" to "Jan."</p>

<p>At first, as is official habit, he was hidebound, but in
Spain by persistence one can achieve anything. In turn Jan,
myself, Antonio and the zapatero, thrust a head through the
hole adding urging to expostulation. Luckily the passport
name was not very clearly written, and at last the official
admitted a compromise: he put "Godfrey Jan," and our
spirits rose once more.</p>

<p>Back we went to the lawyer's office, where, with some delays,
and the expenditure of eighteen pesetas, we turned Antonio
into our representative against the railway companies. We
may add that one year and six months have passed since
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
then; we have since paid twenty-two pesetas more for another
document; and a few months ago we were informed that
possibly our case would come up for settlement next year.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>Before the night was over we also learned to our satisfaction
that Luis had found a job for the zapatero, and that
Antonio had got him a bedroom at the small confectioner's
in a street close by.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

<h4>THE ROAD HOME</h4>


<p>We set out on our journey home next morning. The
bootmaker, who arrived at the house almost before
we were dressed, came with us to the station, where
he presented us with a large packet of angels-hair cakes as
sustenance for the journey. This favourite Murcian delicacy,
made from the inside of a gourd, has a stringy consistency
and a sickly flavour. The zapatero had secured them "on
tick" from the confectioner's where he was lodging. As we
take leave of him, we may summarize his subsequent history
as we drew it by hints and half-made revelations from Antonio
and his companions. I am afraid that the zapatero's account
of his departure from his village may have been invention.
In Murcia he revealed himself as a man who was work-shy.
He borrowed money to get his tools, he got advances on his
wages, he arrived late to work, he ran up a large bill at the
confectioner's; and then, one fine morning, decamped.
This much we gathered. Antonio would never tell us, but
I believe that he himself paid the confectioner's bill after
the zapatero's disappearance; but to what extent our friends
had suffered we could never learn.</p>

<p>As we had just finished breakfast we put the angels-hair
cakes into our haversack. But under the strain of travel
the flimsy paper bag in which they were packed went to
pieces, the angels-hair spread itself in fibrous stickiness all
over the contents of the haversack. We felt no gratitude
to the zapatero for his parting gift.</p>

<p>Our resources, despite an extra hundred pesetas borrowed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
from Antonio, were at a low ebb, and, after some tedious
searching of a Spanish railway guide, we had decided to
make our way home up the east coast of Spain to Barcelona
and thence to Paris. This route was cheaper than that
through Madrid. In addition, we could travel by night,
spending our days in the towns, and thus dodge the expenses
of hotels. We travelled, of course, third class because of
cheapness, and because of the interest which was always
to be found amongst one's fellow passengers. The journey
was cold on account of our thin clothes, and in spite of our
hopes the carriages were so full and the interchanges of
passengers so frequent that we could get no sleep. After
two days and nights we reached Barcelona worn out, having
passed through Alicante, Valencia and Tarragona, but too
weary to get interest or amusement from any of these towns.</p>

<p>We arrived at Barcelona on a chill morning and set out
from the station to look for the British Consul, whom we
wished to consult about our lost luggage. Barcelona is
large, and we waited for a tram. A passer-by told us that
our waiting was vain. There was a traffic strike in progress
and neither tram, omnibus nor cab was to be had. We would
have to walk. Bad luck seemed to have reserved her efforts
for the last few days.</p>

<p>We do not think that England realized the great interest
excited all over the world by the sufferings of the late Mayor
of Cork. While his fate hung in the balance people would
stop us in the streets of Murcia, or even in the outlying
villages, to ask us if we believed that there was a chance of
his recovery. He had died shortly before our homeward
journey began. The Northern parts of Spain see a parallel
between their position and that of Ireland. Indeed, the
parallel is not exact; rather one might compare them to
the position to which Ulster fears to be relegated. The fact
remains that Catalonia and the Basque countries, the hard-working,
commercial parts of Spain, object to the domination,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
laxity and misrule of the Government of Madrid. I believe
that the party which wishes independence, the Spanish Sinn
Fein, is very small; but it has become mixed with socialistic
propaganda, communism, and so forth. At any rate, Barcelona,
combining as it does the excitable nature of the
Spaniard with the organization of a working community,
provides the field for a series of extremely unpleasant strikes,
riots and demonstrations. The transport strike was an
illustration of this. During the two days we were in Barcelona,
three employers were shot in the streets by employés.</p>

<p>To return to the Mayor of Cork. His death was the
signal for a typical demonstration in Barcelona, in favour
of the Sinn Fein and of the Irish Republic. England was
far enough away to remain undisturbed. The English Consul
was at hand. When we reached his house we found that
all his window-glass had been smashed in sympathy for Irish
freedom.</p>

<p>At a first glance Barcelona does not seem to be a Spanish
town. There is something Germanic about it. Sitting in
the main square and watching the people pass by, one could
well imagine oneself in some town on the German border of
Alsace.</p>

<p>We remained in Barcelona two days, recovering from
the fatigues of the journey. On our last afternoon, as we
were strolling through a narrow back street, our attention
was caught by a window full of small figures, baked in clay,
highly coloured and gilt. The figures were all those of saints
and biblical characters, not depicted in the formal manner
of religious moments, but in a familiar and homelike way.
We went into the small shop and asked their purpose, and
were told that these figures were for Christmas decorations.
We bought two&mdash;one of the Blessed Virgin hanging on a
line a chemise which she had just washed, the other an incognita
lady saint with a distaff and a cat.</p>

<p>We had taken up our quarters at a small, disreputable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
lodging-house opposite the station, where they charged us
the exorbitant fee of two pesetas a night each. (We suspect
that the real price was one peseta). The night-watchman
got us out of bed at three o'clock, as our train left at half-past
four in the morning, and the preliminaries to Spanish
travelling are complicated.</p>

<p>To our surprise we found but a small queue of people
waiting at the ticket-office. Our immediate neighbour was
a shabby man in a bowler hat from beneath which showed
the curly black hair of an Italian. He was accompanied
by a middle-aged bustling bourgeois. The bourgeois took
a ticket, which he handed to the Italian. We then demanded
tickets to the French frontier at Cerbere.</p>

<p>"We cannot book you to Cerbere," said the clerk; "the
railway bridge between Figueras and Port Bou has been
damaged. It will not be passable for three days."</p>

<p>We thought drearily of having to return to the lodging-house,
of three days more in this large, transportless town
of Barcelona, of again getting up at three a.m.</p>

<p>At this moment the Italian came to our aid.</p>

<p>"From Figueras," he said, "there are motor-cars which
will carry the passengers over the frontier. You can get
along that way easily."</p>

<p>So we booked to Figueras.</p>

<p>The Italian accompanied us and revealed his history.
He was wandering about, looking for work. He had crossed
the frontier on foot from France. His papers were in a queer
condition, and some of them he had had to leave in the
custody of the frontier officials as a guarantee. But there
was no work in Barcelona, so he was going back once more.
The bourgeois was an employé of the Italian Consulate, who
had come to the station to pay his fare and to see that he
really left the town.</p>

<p>The train rolled along through that rich Catalan scenery
depicted in the landscapes of José Pujo, and at about ten
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
o'clock we reached Figueras. With some difficulty we found
a boy and a hand-cart, by means of which we could transport
our luggage to the diligence office. The road was
uphill and deep in a clayey mud. The poor boy tugged and
pushed, and Jan had to go into the slime to help him.
Through a long, narrow, old-fashioned street, Figueras
opened out into a plaza planted with tall lime trees, the
fallen leaves of which made a sodden carpet on the ground.
The dead leaves seemed to give the dominant note of Figueras,
a note of exhausted melancholy.</p>

<p>Misfortune, as has so often been said, is sometimes good
luck in disguise. More "get on or get out" passengers
had forestalled us with the car, notably a fussy man who,
dragging with him two or three musical instrument cases,
was loudly informing everybody that he had a concert engagement
somewhere in France and that his career would be
blasted if he did not fulfil it. There was no seat left for us.
We turned to the boy and asked him to find us some sleeping
place for the night.</p>

<p>"There is the Grand Hotel," he said.</p>

<p>"Do not talk to us of grand hotels," we answered.
"Grand hotels are institutions which level humanity to a
dead datum of boredom and mulct it of expensive fees in
the process."</p>

<p>"Claro," responded the boy.</p>

<p>"Take us to some local pub," we continued, "where the
stranger rarely intrudes."</p>

<p>The boy, forcing his cart uphill, led us down a side street
to a small wine-shop, the woodwork of whose windows had
recently been painted a gay violet hue. We pushed our way
inside. A man with beady eyes, who might well be called
"black-complexioned," curtly demanded our business. On
our request for a bed he scanned us from head to foot. We
were indeed somewhat respectable, having travelled in our
best clothes for fear of another accident to our luggage,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
wishing, if such occurred, to save the best we had. The dark
man turned to a woman who had a kind of hard, crystalline
beauty, and consulted with her. At last the woman said
in a coarse voice:</p>

<p>"They can have a room if they will take their meals
here."</p>

<p>To which we consented.</p>

<p>The Italian had been following us, vainly begging us
to walk over the frontier with him, but as we had still a
trunk, two rucksacks, and the large Sevillian dish in its
basket, his suggestion did not seem feasible. So we finally
said good-bye to one another, he setting off again on foot
for France.</p>

<p>We were sitting over our coffee after lunch, when the
black-eyed host came near, drew a chair close up to us,
stared at us with perplexed brows for a moment, then said,
suddenly:</p>

<p>"I know why you have come here."</p>

<p>"We have come because the bridge is broken," we said.</p>

<p>He waved this aside.</p>

<p>"You need not mince matters with me," he answered.
"I can see, I have two eyes. I have plenty of opium
upstairs."</p>

<p>"Opium?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you can smuggle it over to France quite easily
from here."</p>

<p>"But we are not smugglers."</p>

<p>"I'll let you have it cheap," answered the host, closing
one eye.</p>

<p>We again protested the entire innocence of our trafficking,
but obviously did not convince him. He knew that people
in our condition did not come to his shanty for nothing.
He renewed his attack after supper.</p>

<p>"Why have you come to my dram shop?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because big hotels are dull," we answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"You have some reason for wanting to get to France
secretly," he persisted. "Your papers, for instance, are
not in order."</p>

<p>We protested that they were.</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid of me," went on our host. "I
am quite trustworthy."</p>

<p>We replied that in spite of the high opinion he had of us
we had done nothing to deserve it.</p>

<p>"Let me see your passports," said the landlord.</p>

<p>"I knew it," he went on, as soon as he had examined
them. "You have not been viséd at Barcelona. You will
not be able to get over the frontier. They will turn you
back."</p>

<p>We had understood that no visé was necessary to get
back into France. He said that we were mistaken.</p>

<p>"This is where I can aid you," said the host. "I can
get you over the frontier, so that you need not pass the
customs or the passport office at all. I have a special route
by which I pass French deserters to and fro. Of course,
as you are not really dangerous, I would only charge you
a small sum&mdash;say forty or fifty pesetas apiece. For the
deserters the charge is considerably higher, as the risk if
caught is considerable; while if you were caught you would
only be sent back again into Spain. One of my men would
drive you up at night, and then at about four o'clock in the
morning you would dash over the frontier. I have sent
hundreds to and fro."</p>

<p>We must confess that the adventure attracted us. We
had just enough money left to pay for the passage, but one
thing deterred us. We had with us all the pictures which
we had painted in Spain. If we were captured these would
possibly be confiscated, and this was a risk we could not
cheerfully face. We told our host that we would take a day to
think it over. The next day we decided that if the bridge
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
were repaired within two days we would go to Cerbere and try
the normal course, but that if the delay were longer we would
take the deserters' route. That day at Figueras was so tedious
that we mutually shortened our probation by a day. On the
morrow, however, we heard by chance that the bridge had been
reopened and that a special train would pass through Figueras
at eleven o'clock. It was then half-past ten. Jan rushed
to pack, while I hurried to our host to find some means of
transport. I found him giving his small child a ride-a-cock-horse
on his foot. To my news he answered that it was
impossible, that we could not reach the train, that it was a
train-de-luxe and terribly expensive, and so on.</p>

<p>After a long and aggravating demur he suddenly turned
to me.</p>

<p>"All right," he exclaimed. "If you <i>will</i> do it, it shall
be done."</p>

<p>He hurried me round a series of back streets, routed out
an old man and a donkey-cart, and in a few minutes the
luggage was packed and we were off to the station. It was
a close race. Jan ran on to get the tickets. I remained
with the old man and the donkey. We had been told to
pay the man a peseta; but he expostulated at the wage,
demanding three. We held firm, however, and at last, with
sighs and groans of despair, the old fellow was going off,
apparently as heartbroken as though a near and dear friend
had died. We called him back and added twopence-halfpenny
to his shilling. He immediately broke into wreathed
smiles and patted us cheerfully on the back, wishing us a
good journey.</p>

<p>At Cerbere our passports were refused. We had to go
back to Port Bou, where the French Vice-Consul stamped
them and, with the loss of another day, we were once more
on our way to Paris. The night journey from Cerbere to
Paris was terrible. Owing to the loss at Lorca we were in
thin summer clothes, the temperature was three degrees
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
below freezing point, owing to some defect in the apparatus
the carriages were not heated, and a bulky market woman
thrust her hand through the glass of the window; so that
for twenty-three hours a freezing draught searched every
cranny of the carriage.</p>

<p>Amongst our lost luggage had been our winter hats, and
we landed in Paris, much to the amusement of the Parisians,
wearing Panama hats in the middle of November.</p>

which is not equally pleasing and instructive to read. But their
dominant feature, which puts them above and beyond all others in
interest and educational value, is the wealth of their illustrations....
No country has ever been illustrated so completely. The
richness of Spain in Moorish and Gothic monuments is incredible,
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Calvert</span> has made them his special study...."<br /></span><br />

    <span style="font-size:0.9em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sketch.</i>&mdash;"These volumes, handsomely bound in the familiar red-and-gold
colours of Spain, are calculated to give English readers a
most comprehensive survey of this fascinating land, and to convey a
clear idea of its historic greatness. The get-up of the books is in
every way worthy of a series of this magnitude&mdash;a series which,
as one reviewer has said, could not have been carried out by another
living author...."<br /></span><br />

    <span style="font-size:0.9em">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Liverpool Courier.</i>&mdash;"Mr. <span class="smcap">Calvert</span>, who is responsible for this
curiously interesting series, is doing a remarkable work for Spain....
He is a good, honest craftsman, with a fine enthusiasm for
his subject, and he is content to set things before us in a straightforward
way. His writing is always readable, so that the service he
does in describing for us the treasures of Spain, and that nation's
great personalities, is really very considerable...."<br /></span><br />
